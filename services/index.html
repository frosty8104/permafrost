<!-- <h1>Brand Design Elements</h1>
<p>Web Design & Development: I create a visual mockup of what each page of your website will look like first. I will consult you for
any tweaks and changes, and after you are satisfied with how it looks, I move onto the development side, using HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript to bring it to life, discussing with you what kind of functionality you need as I progress through bringing your vision to 
life.</p>
<p>Logo Design: Though logo design is considered graphic design, it is an especially important part of your visual brand, thus the 
reason why I put this down separately. I will first discuss with you any concept ideas you have, and then I will create ten sketches
from those ideas. We will discuss which sketch, if any, fit what you are trying to embody with your business, and then I will work on
refining that sketch, and present it to you in black and white. We will discuss if any changes or tweaks need to be made, and add
brand colours. Final discussion will lead to handing over vector versions of the logo to be used on whatever branding pieces you need.
</p> 
<p>Graphic Design: letterhead, vehicle wrap, branded shirts, flyers, brochures, posters, postcards... anything that brand colours, 
logo, and typography are used on for promotions are offered.</p>
<p>Photography: product photography can be used to promote your products and services, along with the graphic design pieces mentioned
above.</p> -->
