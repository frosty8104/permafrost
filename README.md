# permafrost
Permafrost portfolio website was made mainly with the goal of using it for securing a job in web design and development. It might be helpful to other students 
learning code to study the structure of HTML and CSS, and JavaScript; also helpful to potential employers to display my skill level.

Features:
This website includes:
* Homepage with skills list, ASCII avatar & sample
* About page with about blurb, target job blurb, target clients blurb, hobbies blurb & interests blurb
* Portfolio page:
* 3 design pieces with descriptions, case studies & links
* 3 development pieces with descriptions & links
* 3 sample photos
* Contact page with form and social media links in footer

How to run Permafrost website locally:
Clone from Github into a local folder
https://github.com/frosty8104/permafrost

ToDo list:
* Finish designing/developing vet website & horse rescue website so I can change out a couple website pieces for more appropriate ones for my intended clients.
* Make website full stack once I learn back-end
* Code users: please report any bugs or submit ideas for features
