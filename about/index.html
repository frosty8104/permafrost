<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="../img/frostgnome.jpg" alt="Laura" />
</div>
<div class="intro">
<p>Hi, my name is Laura, and I am creative, which means I like to code and put colours and fonts together in visual presentations. I also have a passion for 
animals and their welfare and would love to help out shelters or any other animal-related establishments.</p>
<p>Job: I'm looking for any jobs that will improve and expand my design and development skillset. Graphic design intern, junior front-end developer, web 
developer, web designer, I'll take anything that gets me where I want to be.</p>
<p>Clients: I'm looking for clients from businesses and non-profits that operate in the animal world. I would like to offer brand and web design to pet shops, 
veterinarians, rescues, and shelters, to name a few.</p>
</div>
<div class="hobby">
<p>Hobbies: 3D modeling, reading fiction books (Harry Potter, Star Wars, Black Stallion, to name a few), writing, planning & designing 
Dragonriders of Pern game (unofficially), writing, planning, & designing my own game, as well as writing prequel comics, writing short stories, and playing 
video games, mainly World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Interests: I love design of all sorts, specifically web design and development and graphic design focusing on brand design. I also have a passion and 
interest in animal welfare and would like to be involved in behaviour, care, and training of cats, dogs, and horses, or at least hands-on training. As a side 
note, I'd like to be able to make my own place, so I would like to learn architectural design and construction, and landscaping. Other interests of mine that 
could be hobbies are sewing, robotics - both mechanical and programming, animation, digital painting, and drawing. (I do ok with drawing, but my proportions 
are definitely off and I haven't done any for a long time.)</p>
