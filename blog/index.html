                    <h1>WEB DESIGN/DEV</h1> 
                    <h2 id="box-flex">Box Model Vs Flexbox</h2>
                    <p>Progress requires steps, and one of the frst steps to modern web design afer learning about HTML and CSS was to 
                    create a website from a design composite. For example, Rogue Pickings is a mobile meal delivery service.<br>
                    Rogue Pickings prides itself on providing meals with fresh ingredients, and the whole website is geared toward 
                    letting people know where they are, what they do, and what they offer. As a web developer, I was taught by 
                    Skillcrush’s Break Into Tech Blueprint to start with HTML and CSS using the box model, employing foat, clear, 
                    margin, padding, box-sizing, text-align, display, and width propertes to set up content placing for the site. For 
                    styling, color for text, background for background-color, font-size, font-weight, font-family, text-transform, 
                    text-decoraton, border-botom, border-top, border-right, and list-style propertes are used.<br>
                    So, since Rogue Pickings is an example, frst we set the body font size to 16 pixels, font-family to Montserrat with 
                    alternatve optons of Helvetca and Arial if the browser can’t use the frst font, and ’sans serif’ for font style. 
                    Then we set the header h1, h2, h3, and h4 to font-weight 700 resultng in bolded headings, and text-transform 
                    uppercase so all the headers are in capitals; afer that, you set h1 to font-size 30px, h2 to font-size 24px, h3 to 
                    20px, h4 to 12px, and p line-height to 36px. That takes care of main styles, so what’s next? Time to set header 
                    styles and placement. H1 needs to be foated to the lef, margin should be set to 0, padding, which will push h1 down 
                    from the top and give space at the bottom, should be set to 36px 0, which means 36px top and botom, and 0px lef and 
                    right. Phase two is to make Rogue Pickings responsive. For starters, you need to delete all floats, clears, margins, 
                    and padding propertes. You may have to add some padding later, but for now clear all the aforementioned properties 
                    out. Flexbox properties include align-items, flex-directon, justify-content, wrap, and flex-flow. Flex-flow is a 
                    hybrid property using fex-directon and wrap. For starters, Rogue Pickings has a green theme, so you will want to 
                    apply #77a466, a light forest green, to your header, header h1, and .main-image img as a 3px solid border-bottom, 
                    and color for header h1 span, header nav ul li a, .main-ttle h2, .menu li, and footer span. (Apologies, Canadian 
                    and/or Britsh speakers, yes, you have to use the United States spelling or it won’t work.) H1, h2, and h3 headers 
                    are assigned the color black, .reviews are assigned color: #333, and .secton-one, .secton-two, .secton-three, and 
                    footer are assigned border-top: 1px solid #eee. Assign font-size 16px to html, and font-family ‘Montserrat’, 
                    Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif to body, providing default fonts for each browser if the first one is not available. 
                    Next, block up h1, h2, and h3 and apply text-transform: uppercase and font-weight: 700 to bold the headings; next, 
                    assign a font size of 1.875em to h1, 1.125em to h2, 0.75em to h3, and 0.875em to p, respectvely. Let’s take a break 
                    for styling and work on positoning; for body, align-items: center and display: flex, for .container, header, 
                    .top-secton, .botom-secton, and footer you need align-items: center, display: flex, flex-flow: row wrap, and 
                    justify-content: center. How about secton and div widths? Assign .container max-width: 1200px, and width: 90%, header, 
                    header h1, .main-image img, .secton-one, .secton-two, .secton-three, and footer are given width: 100%. Add text-align: 
                    center to header and footer, text-align: lef to .main-ttle h2, font-size: 1em to .main-ttle p, .reviews, and .address, 
                    as well as line-height: 1.56 to .main-title p, 1.5625 to .reviews and 1.5 to .address, respectvely. Assign padding: 
                    20px to header h1 and padding-top: 10px to .secton-one, .secton-two, and .secton-three; footer span is given 
                    font-family: ‘Galada’, cursive, text-transform: lowercase, and font-size: 0.875em. (Note: all property/descripton 
                    pairings must be writen with a colon afer a property, and a semicolon afer the descripton to work. For example: color: 
                    #77a466;) Last, but not least, are the two lists on the website: ul is assigned margin: 0, header nav is given width:
                    50%, header nav ul is given padding: 0, header nav ul li is assigned font-weight: 700 (bold), font-size 0.875em, and 
                    text-transform: uppercase. Both header nav ul li and .menu li are assigned padding: 10px 0; .menu and header nav ul li 
                    is given list-style: none. Margin: 0 is assigned to ul, and header nav ul li a gets text-decoraton: none. Padding or 
                    margin: 0, list-style: none, and text-decoraton: none are given to lists to remove the indent from the side, remove 
                    any bullets or numbers from a list, and text- decoraton: none removes lines from under links.<br>
                    On to the media queries! For tablet, @media all and (min-width: 768px) with .bottom section being assigned align-items: 
                    flex-start, justfy-content: space-between, and width: 100%, .section-one, .section-two, and .section-three assigned 
                    border-top 1px solid #eee, and flex-basis: 31.4% to fill their assigned areas. Lastly, .section-two is assigned border-left 
                    and .border-right 1px solid #eee, and padding: 0 20px. For desktop, @media all and (min-width: 1200px) header is assigned 
                    justfy-content: space-between, header h1 gets border-botiom: none, padding: 2% 0 2% 0, text-align: lefi, and width: 30%; 
                    header nav is assigned width: 40%, and header nav ul is assigned display: flex and justify- content: space-between. If you 
                    enjoyed this dissecton of writng a website, go look at Skillcrush.com for more coding and design fun. This is just a 
                    sample of the projects they teach you to build.</p>
                    <h2 id="git">Git Goin on Design!</h2>
                    <p>Git? What’s that? Version control... well, that doesn’t mean much to me. Wait, I can backup my projects with it? 
                    Excellent! THAT makes it useful! And helps me work with other developers on a code project without overwritng any 
                    of their parts – now we’re getting somewhere.<br>
                    So how do I do that? Apparently, there’s a tool called terminal native to a computer’s operatng system – hmmm, 
                    think I’ve come across that before. Let’s see... Applicatons/Utlites/Terminal (apologies, Microsof folks, using a 
                    Macintosh, so no idea where Terminal would be on your computers). So, time to free up Terminal and take it for a 
                    test drive!<br>
                    Sooo... terminal opened, now what do I do? Hmm, so git – -version will tell me if I have it already or not; 
                    git-scm.com gets me either git if I don’t have it or an update if I do. Wonderful, now I can play with it. 
                    Alrighty, so... now I need to confgure the git environment if it’s a new install; git confg user.name for username, 
                    git config user.email for e-mail – straight forward enough. And there we go – all set up! Now I can actually use it. 
                    So, navigate to the folder where you want your repository, and then create repository in the command line of your 
                    terminal: git init .... I assume that means initalize repository; git status tells you what fles in the folder are 
                    available to add to the repository. To add fles to the folder: frst git add and the fle name, and then git commit -m 
                    “Message you want to leave”. Git status will tell you where you are in the repository process, or you can git log to 
                    see a history of commands that you’ve entered into the command line in terminal. Git is built like a tree, so you 
                    create branches of the main code and then merge them with that code when you’re done. So, to make a change to your 
                    base code, enter git branch into the command line; now you can make the changes you want on your code (say maybe you 
                    want to change your white background to grey), and then git merge to merge it back into the main code. To create the 
                    branch and switch to it you input git checkout -b branchname... that makes sure you’re in the right code to begin 
                    with. Git checkout master sends you back to the main code; stll with me? Now to merge: git merge branchname; we’ve 
                    now taken care pf making a local repository, but we stll need a remote repository, right? To both keep us from losing 
                    all the work we did as well as to have it available to other members on the team if we’re working on said project as 
                    part of a group.<br>
                    Enter github, where remote repositories are stored. So, over to github.com to sign up... don’t you just love how you 
                    have to sign up for everything? Anyway, username, e-mail, password – all the usual stuf. For creatng remote 
                    repositories, you can either use htps protocol or ssh protocol; recommended protocol is the ssh, as it’s more secure. 
                    Ssh is a pair of keys, one private and one public, that verifes your identty.<br>
                    New repository (green buton on your Github dashboard) creates a new repository. If you want to fnd out if you have 
                    any remote repositories connected to your local one, git remote -v; git remote add origin 
                    git@github.com:your-username/local-git-repository.git. Now we need to push the fles to github: git push -u origin 
                    master. (I’ve covered most but not all material in this module of Skillcrush Tech Blueprint – there is a lot to 
                    cover; (Informaton taken from the Skillcrush Tech Blueprint website and paraphrased)</p>
                    <h2 id="HoL">House of Light</h2>
                    <p>Redesigned House of Light website: <a href="https://houseoflightllc.org">https://houseoflightllc.org/</a><br>
                    Few projects hit home like this did. I can’t just believe that it was chance that I was invited to collaborate on 
                    this project because it directly relates to my history from birth. I was invited to collaborate on a redesign of 
                    this company website called House of Light. At the tme, I had no idea what the company did out in the world, I just 
                    knew that my fellow Skillcrush student colleague, Tauri StClaire, was in a volunteer team to redesign the website.
                    <br>
                    A litle bit of background on me: I was born legally blind, and at two years old was diagnosed with underdeveloped 
                    optic nerve, and would have ended up with a seeing-eye dog if not for my parents bringing me to a miracle service that 
                    restored my sight, though I will note it’s not perfect, as I’m stll nearsighted.<br>
                    Anyway, on to the project. House of Light is a company that offers teaching to blind and low-vision individuals for 
                    both educaton and corporate needs. Nuff said? I was one designer of two on a team of two designers and two developers, 
                    and I have to say I really enjoyed the experience overall and learned a lot through feedback from the rest of the team 
                    as well as pointers from the owner of the company herself. My fellow designer, Matt, designed the header and footer, 
                    along with the hero image for the homepage. Thanks to his inital design, I was able to copy the brand theme of the 
                    website onto future pages that I designed. I now feel tons more comfortable with Figma, whereas before I preferred to 
                    use Affinity Photo for designing pages, although the one downside of Affinity is that the font sizes don’t actually 
                    translate straight across. Alas, I stll feel like my graphic design skills are sadly lacking, especially regarding 
                    logos. Something to work on, right? Anyway, back to designing, or rather redesigning this website.<br>
                    Brand colours by hex were black: #040707, dark blue: #102e96, dark gold: #a58129, white: #fff, and medium grey: 
                    #8f9194, or by Coolors name Dark Goldenrod, Internatonal Klein Blue, Black, White, and Batleship Grey. Part of 
                    designing a website is to check for contrast and accessibility, and I found out that Dark Goldenrod did not mesh with 
                    the black. I found a similar gold that did, hex #bc429f, or Satn Sheen Gold according to Coolors, and replaced that 
                    gold with the original, and then was able to ask the client during one of our meetngs if she was ok with that, afer 
                    explaining why I changed it. She was, and so we that gold replaced the original gold in the brand colours. Original 
                    fonts were Apple SD Gothic Neo for main typeface, Hiragino Kaku Gothic for primary typeface, and Avenir for secondary 
                    typeface. I’m not entrely sure what’s meant by primary and secondary, but I’m kinda assuming primary is for headings 
                    besides the main header, and secondary for the paragraphs. Those fonts were felt by the client/owner to be too 
                    educatonally professional, and she wanted a more corporate professional feel, so we were asked to change fonts. Also, 
                    this was a volunteer team for the redesign, and the owner wanted to save costs, so the fonts had to be free and 
                    readily available. The design team, mainly Matt, decided on Cormorant SD for the main header ttle, Montserrat for all 
                    the other headers, and Quicksand for the paragraphs.<br>
                    Pages that I designed or had a part in designing were the Partners, Careers, Press, Services, Contact, Products, and 
                    Blog pages. It was good practce for the design aspect, and good practce for teamwork required in workplace setng, and 
                    I learned a lot more than I would have if I had been doing it solo.</p>
                    <h2 id="perma">Permafrost - The Foundation</h2>
                    <p><b>HTML, CSS, Box Model, Git, and Github</b><br>
                    So, now that I have a foundaton in HTML, CSS, Git, Github, and the Command Line in Terminal, next step is too make 
                    a portolio website. Am I ready? Heck yes! I spent soo much tme trying to fgure out how to do it, and the new tools 
                    I’ve become familiar with will defnitely do the trick. Finally I can display my works to the world properly.<br>
                    Step one: fgure out my content. Let’s see... I have blue shades and black and white from my logo, and I know I want 
                    blue in my brand colours, and not just because it’s my favourite colour. Blue in colour psychology means loyalty, 
                    dependability, trust, reliability... all things I want to perpetuate in my business. Other brand colours: white 
                    means clarity, black means serious, and grey, or silver, means balance and calm. Make sense?<br>
                    Logo: wolf or dog paw in blue shades, with the biggest pad being a camera lens. Typography: Impact font with 
                    rounded corners in white, with both logo and typeface outlined in black.<br>
                    Website typography: Open Sans for headers and navigaton – sans means sans serif or missing the ‘tails’ on certain 
                    letters, and Droid Serif for general text, like paragraphs, captons on pictures, things like that.<br>
                    Pictures: need a picture of me for sure, for my About Me page, and then pictures of the various projects I’ve done 
                    so far. So, fnished wireframe of my website homepage design, my fnished business card design, my logo icon design, 
                    my fnished brand logo design for fcttous company The Whole Bean cofee shop, icons for The Whole Bean, my 
                    personalized version of the WordPress website, a picture of my fnished client website WhereRV?, all from various 
                    Skillcrush modules I’ve completed so far. Also, a picture of Ninja for both my portolio page and About Me page, and 
                    a picture of a somewhat fnished 3D horse model in Blender, and social media icons for my contact page.<br>
                    Okay, now that I have my content in order, tme to go about coding this thing to look like a website. So, I need a 
                    header div for my logo & typeface, a secton with one div for my samples list, and a div for my sample pictures, a 
                    section with two divs for my reviews, and a div for my footer on my homepage. For my about page, I need a logo div, 
                    three sectons with a picture div and a text div each, and a footer div. Portolio page needs a logo div, three 
                    sections with three divs each for my picture, heading, and a descripton of each picture, and a footer div. Contact 
                    page need a logo div, a text div, and a footer div. I also recently added a blog page, which required a logo div, 
                    a blog secton with picture, heading, and blog post div, a sidebar div, and a footer div. This page is stll very 
                    much a work in progress – not that any site isn’t – so I will be adding more blog posts once I fgure out how to add 
                    somethings, like a working comment box, a read more feature for blog posts, among other things. (Hint: WordPress 
                    makes it so much easier to do this, but I’m stubborn, so I want it to work on my HTML website as well.)<br>
                    Now for the css part of coding – adding colour, text style, all the things that make up the visual parts of a 
                    website. Yeah, I could leave it at HTML, but then everyone would just see a list of black text, pictures, and blue 
                    underline text denotng the links. No, thank you. Websites need structure! So, tme to style this website to make it 
                    look good! Width, height, foat where needed, font sizes, and colours for background and text.<br>
                    Now, tme to back it up with git and github. Terminal: cd path-to-folder-I-have-my-website-stuff-in, git init to 
                    create local repository, git add all fles.extension. Over to github: create repository, copy and paste code git 
                    remote add origin git@github.com:username/folder.git. Press enter, then paste git push -u origin master. There, 
                    all backed up in a remote repository. Now, for displaying it: git branch gh-pages, and then git push origin 
                    gh-pages. (Website can be viewed at htps://frosty8104.github.io/portolio/)</p>

                    (One month before Irean Icebolt’s birthday...)<br>
                    “Greetngs, Master Alcorn. Might I inquire how much that beautiful black horse in the nearby stables is?”<br>
                    “Ten thousand gold, Miss.”<br>
                    “Ah, thank you.” Læurell watched her cousin carefully, saw the slight shoulder drop of dejecton. Aha! Finally, the 
                    perfect present.. if only she could raise the money somehow.<br>
                    “Ahoy, Miss hunter?”<br>
                    “Yes, Master Alcorn.”<br>
                    “Been seeing you around a lot. How are things going in the huntng business? With them witches around I’d imagine 
                    it’s a litle tough.”<br>
                    “Oh, my pets handle them just fne. And I’m also fairly handy with a bow, so they don’t really last that long between 
                    the two of us.”<br>
                    “Glad to hear it. I’m glad Lady Waycrest is around, else I’d be thinking of picking up and moving, with all that’s 
                    going on here.”<br>
                    “Stay safe, Master Alcorn.”<br>
                    “You as well, Miss...?”<br>
                    “Læurell Gearbow, sir.”
                    <span>****</span>
                    “So, what’s this meetng about, Cousin Læurell?” Nuffin was the frst cousin bold enough to ask why the hunter had called all her cousins, 
                    except Irean, together.<br>
                    “I’ve seen Cousin Irean eyeing the black chargers for sale out in Drustvar, and I had a thought. She *really* wants one, because when she 
                    and I were questing in Drustvar, she asked the Quartermaster how much it was, and she was quite disappointed afer hearing it would cost 
                    ten thousand gold.”<br> 
                    “Okay. So somehow or other we have to get that much together to get her that horse then.” Emalina surmised.<br>
                    “If possible, aye.”<br>
                    “Well, we defnitely have our work cut out for us then. We should visit the bank frst.”
                    <span>****</span>
                    “How much gold have you?” Nuffin popped out of the shadows closest to Læurell, making her jump.<br>
                    “You scared me!”<br>
                    “Sowwy.”<br>
                    “Three thousand. And I will take two of that.”<br>
                    “M’ok.. I can contribute that much as well.” Nufy asserted. “And me!” Lina piped up.<br>
                    “And me!” Tanky echoed.<br>
                    “Me too!” Noumi said.<br>
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Hello, Master Alcorn.”<br>
                    “Hello, Miss Gearbow.”<br>
                    “I have here ten thousand gold to purchase a Smoky Charger. If I could have it delivered in a month’s time to a farm about a quarter mile 
                    north of Stormwind. If you have never been there, send a mail to me and I will meet you to guide you.”<br>
                    “Thanks for the ofer, but I think I will be fine travelling there. Does anyone in those parts know about your farm?”<br>
                    “Aye, you could probably ask anyone in Elwynn Forest or Stormwind for the hunter gnome’s abode and they will point you to it. I.. kind 
                    of... supply the leather thereabouts. I hunt often.”<br>
                    “Ah. Very good then. I will be sure to do that. There is a dock in Stormwind is there not?”<br>
                    “Aye, there is.”<br>
                    “Well then, I will see you in a month.”
                    <span>****</span>
                    Læurell peered around the corner. O good, her cousins were stll keeping Irean busy with gifts and such. A muffled knocking sounded behind 
                    her, and she turned to go answer the door before her white-haired mage cousin started to get an inkling that somebody was at the door. She 
                    quietly opened the door and just as quietly closed it behind her.<br>
                    “Hi. I’m Læurell, the gnome who talked to you a few days ago. Is it here?”<br>
                    “Aye, it be here, lass. Heck of a time I had of getting here.”<br>
                    “Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. There will be a very excited gnome when she sees the present we got her though.”<br>
                    “Well, I’m glad to hear that. I’m off.”<br>
                    “Thank you very much, Quartermaster Alcorn. Are you sure you can’t or wouldn’t like to stck around to watch us surprise her?”<br>
                    “Afraid I can’t, Miss Læurell. Other deliveries to make. Be sure to give the birthday gnome my best, aye?”<br>
                    “Thank you! I will!”
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Okay, Cousin Renie, one last gift. You have to close your eyes for this one. And let me guide you. No peeking!” Læurell placed her hands 
                    on Irean’s arms from behind, gently pushing her forward towards the door. Emalina held it open, winking at the hunter as she pushed the 
                    white haired mage out of the house, guiding her over the path to the stables.<br>
                    “Ok, you can open your eyes now. Look up!” The mage blinked her blue eyes, tilted her head up, and gasped.<br>
                    “How did you...?!” A black horse head descended to whufe the mage’s hair.<br>
                    “We cousins pooled our gold to get you your own mount. I know we can all choose from any mount in the stables, but we know you’ve been 
                    eyeing a certain horse from the new lands...”<br>
                    “‘E’s beautiful! Thank you, thank you, thank you!” Tears glistened in her eyes. “Best present EVER!”
                    <span>****</span>
                    A spectral wolf howled at the moon; a black armoured cat stepped out of the shadows, and they nodded to each other 
                    before the cat shifed to stag form, the ghost wolf transforming to a Draenei as she leapt onto the druid’s back. 
                    Thundering hooves and pattering feet sounded behind them; a white haired gnome on a black horse led the charge, 
                    followed by a brown haired gnome on a tan wolf accompanied by a smaller white wolf, a red haired gnome on a fox, a 
                    black haired gnome on a owl - faced creature, a white ponytailed gnome on an armoured manasaber, and a black-
                    ponytailed gnome on a white-striped cat. The stag bounded afer them as they passed, heading of on a nightme 
                    adventure.</p>

                    PROLOGUE<br>
                    “Ok, sweet litle baby girl, it’s time for bed I think.” Lunasea Lightningbolt gently placed baby Irean in her crib, lightly wrapping her in 
                    a blanket of lightning tendrils. Leaving the sleeping baby, Luna gently closed the door to the nursery and meandered over to the kitchen, 
                    where her husband was just fnishing up his dessert.<br>
                    “She fell asleep, now she’s in her crib, and we have some alone time.”<br>
                    “Wonderful news, darling.” Phinnly Pyrogear swooped his wife up in his arms, and carried her off to their bed.<br>
                    “I do hope Irean’s sleeping ok.” Luna turned over to face her husband. “I worry when she’s not in my sight.”<br>
                    “I’m sure she’s fine, honey.”<br>
                    “Maybe I should check on her.”<br>
                    “For the sixth tme? She’s fine! And you’d do well to attend to me instead of worrying about her.” Luna lay a long time in bed worrying, 
                    long afer Phinnly fell asleep; finally, she fell asleep too. Worries about her daughter chased her through her dreams, so it was a fitul 
                    sleep, but at least she did get some.<br>
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Luna checked on Irean the next morning, finding a wide eyed baby gnome watching her every move.<br>
                    She reached into the crib to pick her litle girl up, and her hands jerked back as she felt searing cold. Irean was still watching her, her 
                    expression one of curiosity – but she was now encased in a layer of ice. Luna was familiar enough with using ice block herself to know that 
                    this was exactly what was happening. This new development was... interestng, as Irean had never manifested any magical powers untl now.<br>
                    <span>*****</span>
                    TEN YEARS LATER...<br>
                    Irean kept her eyes focused on the two gnomes facing the line she was in, listening for when they called her name.<br>
                    “Nyassa Firespark.”<br>
                    “Here!” For a second, Irean eyed the brown haired gnome beside her, quickly returning her gaze to those who were taking, as she’d heard the 
                    term, “roll call”.<br>
                    “Irean Icebolt.”<br>
                    “Here.”<br>
                    “Hi there! I live in Ironforge. You?” Nyassa eyed her with interest.<br>
                    “I was sent here from Gnomeregan... all I ‘member was that I used to wake up encased in an ice block. Mom and Dad didn’t know what to do 
                    with me, so they sent me to Mistress Bink to see if she could do anythin’. They’re friends, y’know.” Irean was studying the floor, rather 
                    embarrased.<br>
                    “O!... Well, I’se fire mage. I like to burn things.” Nyassa grinned at her. “I can show you around, if you like.” Ny paused. “You have prety 
                    hair, by the way. Speckled brown and white the way it is...”<br>
                    Irean looked up. “I’d like that please. And thank you... Mistress Bink said it might turn all white. I don’t know much about it but sounds 
                    like my ‘frosty outbursts’ as she called ’em seem to be doing that.” “Really?”<br>
                    “Muhuh.”<br>
                    “We has free tme now. Shall I start giving you a tour?”<br>
                    “Yes, please!”<br>
                    Nyassa was true to her word, introducing Irean to every nook and cranny she knew about in Ironforge.<br>
                    “So, we mages live in the Mystc Ward, along with paladins. This door to my left opens into the Forlorn Cavern, where rogues and warlocks 
                    are quartered. Mistress Bink says the warlocks practice darker arts than we mages do, and generally recommends avoiding them as much as 
                    possible.”<br>
                    “Have you ever met a rogue?”<br>
                    “N’really. They be sneaky, so most tmes y’don’t notice them.”<br>
                    “Oh.”<br>
                    “Next to the cavern is the Hall of Explorers where the Explorers League people are when they’re not out exploring. Next to that is my 
                    favourite place to go when we have tme of from magical studies: Tinker Town. They have so many neat gadgets! I usually blink through the 
                    Great Forge to get there... going through the cavern makes me nervous. Other side ‘o Tinker Town is the Military Ward, where warriors spend 
                    their time – been there once once but they’re awfully strict there, an’ I don’t like it, so I tend to avoid it. To my right is the Commons, 
                    where there’s a bank for putting all your valuable stuff in, and an inn for travellers to stay in when visitn’. And that completes the 
                    circle around the Great Forge. So, where would you like to go frst?”<br>
                    “H’bout Tinker Town?” Ny’s eyes lit up at the suggeston, and off they blinked towards a hallway to the Forge.</p>

                    Irean Icebolt made a disgusted face when she peeked at the laundry tub that her cloth armour was in. Pink soapy water swirled with bits of 
                    dirt and vegetaton.<br>
                    “Something wrong, cousin Renie?” Emalina approached from behind.<br>
                    “Don’ like cleaning day.” She pointed at the tub in front of her in emphasis.<br>
                    “O. That.” Lina’s fat voice gave evidence to the fact that she, too, didn’t like cleaning day.<br>
                    Irean carefully picked out her armour pieces, dumping the dirty water before motoning her water elemental to use its waterbolt to refll 
                    it.<br>
                    “Need another bucket, Lina? Or would you be okay with sharing?” Lina sidled closer to the tub, assessing its size.<br>
                    “Seems big ‘nuf to share. Thank you, cousin Ire.” Lina dumped her dirty armour in the tub, and both gnomes set to scrubbing the stained 
                    cloth untl it was as clean as they could make it.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Emryss Shadowstep dumped her leather armour on the table to go gather cleaning implements.<br>
                    Noumi rolled into the building and started shucking her armour of in preparaton for cleaning it; she glanced over at Em as Nuffin came in to 
                    take her armour off in preparaton for cleaning.<br>
                    “Such a chore is cleaning day.” Noumi Ohmist said, shaking the leather pieces out of as much dust as she could.<br>
                    “Maybe if you stopped rolling everywhere it would be less dirty?” Nuffin Shadowblade teased; Noumi stuck her tongue out at her cousin.<br>
                    “Gnomes. Just like children.” Emryss rolled her eyes at the ceiling. “I pray Elune has more patence than I do.” The gnomes darted glances 
                    at her, visibly frightened. She grimaced. “I promise not to go feral on either of you. Let us do a thorough job of cleaning this 
                    armour.”<br>
                    The gnomes and the night elf got to work, scrubbing at their armour with dampened cloths rubbed in soap made for leather. As clean as the 
                    armour could be, it glinted where the sunbeams hit.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Frost wolf Frosty sat watching his master and friend as she set to work cleaning her mail armour, teasing out blades of grass, polishing 
                    dirt away, scrubbing at blood stains; Talley Wolfrunner stopped her own armour cleaning to watch the gnome for awhile.<br>
                    “You have a gift, nimble-fnger Læurell.”<br>
                    “Thank you, Miss Talley. Cousin Renie noticed that as well. I'm embarrassed to say I never thought much of it.” Talley turned back to her 
                    own armour.<br>
                    “Well, now you know it is a gift. And you will use it, yes?”<br>
                    “Thank you, Miss Talley, I will.” The Dranei shaman returned to cleaning her armour, sneaking glances every so ofen at her gnome hunter 
                    friend. “I would like to request your help when you are finished with your armour, Miss Laurell.”<br>
                    “Of course! Happy to help.” Laurell darted a shy smile in Talley’s directon
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Tankytyke Rageblade stood at the forge, hammering away at dents in her plate armour. “O yes, and that’s where that pinching was coming 
                    from. My, what a mess this armour is.”<br>
                    *Clang* *clang* *clang* She hammered away at a dent untl it was back to its original shape. She carefully went over her armour, finding 
                    dents in the plates that shouldn’t be there and using her hammer to reshape it to the way it should be.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    One by one, Læurell’s cousins approached her wearing their armour, presentng for a fnal inspecton. Læurell Gearbow dutfully inspected each 
                    set, using her superior observaton skills to look for any dirt, vegetaton, or stains that the others might have missed. Satsfed they were 
                    clean, the gnomes and other races took of their armour and hung it in the closet, waitng for when they had to use it again.</p>

                    Irean pulled her horse to a stop beside the inn in Boralus. Nyassa had said twenty minutes, and she figured she had ten minutes left before 
                    the other mage showed up. She dismounted, keeping a light hand on the reins while checking mail for the supplies cousin Læurell said she’d 
                    send.<br>
                    “O boy.” She murmured to herself. Her mail was full to overfowing with packages of food; she’d told Læurell she didn’t know how long she 
                    and the other mages would be gone from civilizaton, but she hadn’t expected *this*. It was just a simple exploraton trip, right? How long 
                    could that possibly take? “Oh my. Cousin Læurell definitely outdid herself this time.”<br>
                    “Could I get help unloading this, please?”<br>
                    “Of course! I brought some land sharks along for just in case.”<br>
                    Irean grimaced while nodding. ‘Just in case’ meant Ny was kinda sorta expectng an attack somewhere along the way, though hoping it wouldn’t 
                    happen.<br>
                    “Ny! Ire!” Sara arrived, totng a backpack – full of enchantng supplies, Ire was sure. Ire felt the whisper of wind at her back, and glanced 
                    around to see the other two mages standing straighter. “Nuffin?” Three rogues materialized.<br>
                    “May I has some cross-ants before you go please, Cousin Sara? I haven’t had any in so very long, and Cousin Quyl told me she heard 
                    from Cousin Læurell that it might be awhile before you come back.”<br>
                    “Of course, Lyri!” Sara conjured up some croissants for her red-haired cousin.<br>
                    “Messages every day, right, Cousin Ire? If there’s no word after a week, we *are* coming afer you.” The white haired mage nodded.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Nuffy’s raven swooped in from the north just as Læurell’s wolf hawk dropped in from the south.<br>
                    “You told her?” Læurell clutched the saddle as her mount hovered in the air. Nuffy nodded. “She agreed to send messages daily. I told her 
                    that if there was nothing after a week, we rogues would be coming afer her.”<br>
                    “Good. Thank you. We hunters would be joining you.”<br>
                    “Figgered.”
                    <span>****</span>
                    Irean’s black horse pranced nervously along next to Nyassa’s Mekgineer’s Chopper, which carried Lessära in the sidecar.<br>
                    “So where should we go frst?” Irean leaned towards the chopper below to be heard.<br>
                    “H’bout we visit Stormsong first?” Ny briefy looked up to answer before returning her attention to the road. Sara, surrounded by five 
                    sleeping kites, nodded eagerly.<br>
                    “Brennadam ho!” Sara quipped. Ny pushed down the gas peddle on her chopper, and Ire urged her steed to speed up. Charcoal launched into a 
                    gallop, chasing the speeding chopper down the road. “Wheeeeeeee!” Sara’s retreatng shout of enjoyment drifted back to horse and rider.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Arriving at the edge of the town, all three gnomes took a moment to survey the situaton. Irean’s blue eyes roamed around, her head 
                    swivelling from one directon to the opposite directon and back again; she was subliminally aware of the other two gnomes doing the same. 
                    The town *seemed* safe enough, with its residents wandering to and fro on their business; something that Irean couldn’t put her finger on 
                    made her nervous though, like something bad was about to happen. The gnomes exchanged glances, and became peripherally aware of a child 
                    approaching them. Despite misgivings and internal turmoil, they all three turned smiles on the approaching child, and raised a hand to 
                    wave in greetng. The child waved back, and then the town fell into shadow, a shiver of cold running down each gnomes back. They looked up, 
                    mouths gaping in alarm at the sight of orcs, trolls, and other members of the Horde rappelling down from zeppelins, from which the shadows 
                    came. Ire slid of her mount, preparing for her first cast; a quick glance to the left to see Ny and Sara also standing on the ground,
                    channeling magic for their frst casts. Ty, Ninja, Callie, Squee, and Mal she spotted hiding under the chopper, backs arched as far as they 
                    could go under the vehicle’s undercarriage. The frst opponent they were presented with was an orc; Ire stomped her feet, spraying a frost 
                    nova in his directon to arrest his forward movement. Ny scorched him, and Sara fnished him of with an arcane blast followed by arcane 
                    barrage. Thus began the war to stay alive. The three gnomes were fine working together to bring down foes, but it became harder as they 
                    started to get separated. Exhausted and cornered, they were finally caught, with nets dropped upon them.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Irean woke up groggily, dimly aware of being in a jail-type cell. As her awareness increased, she discreetly glanced around, looking for 
                    Sara and Ny.<br>
                    “Your friends will be back shortly.” Irean jumped a bit, then scanned the room again. A black Tauren stood against the far wall facing 
                    her.<br>
                    “How did you..?” She cut herself short as piercing blue eyes focused on her face.<br>
                    “I am sorry about this. The Horde may be at war with the Alliance, but it doesn’t mean we all agree with our leader’s methods. Orcs have honour, 
                    we have our connecton with the earth, even trolls have some code of honour, but the goblins and the forsaken, especially the Lady Windrunner...” 
                    The Tauren trailed of, shaking her shaggy head.<br>
                    “What’s to be done with us?”<br>
                    “Our leader would like to interrogate you three personally before executng you. If I can, I will not allow it.”<br>
                    “You disagree with gnome punting?”<br>
                    The Tauren chuckled a bit. “I do.”<br>
                    “We had five cats travelling with us.”<br>
                    “They only brought in you three, so I assume they didn’t find your pets.” The door opened, and no less than six orcs walked in, two carrying 
                    struggling gnomes.<br>
                    “It will be over soon.” One orc said gruffly as the two gnomes were dumped on the foor just inside the cell door; the door slammed shut, and 
                    the orcs left. Ire shuffled toward the two gnome-shaped lumps that represented her sisters-in-arms and closest friends. Ny struggled up to a 
                    sitting positon, her eyes squinched together; Sara’s eyes looked bruised.<br>
                    “Ny? Sara?” Ire used her quiet voice. “Are you ok?”<br>
                    “She.. showed us what our fate will be afer she’s done with us. She forced us to watch as she executed - no, ripped to shreds – Alliance 
                    prisoners. You were only spared because you were stll unconscious. She’s MEAN, and without conscience.” Ny allowed herself to be pulled up with 
                    Ire’s help.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    “When did you last hear from cousin Ire?” Lyricka had emerged from the bank on her *very* rare fun days, where she took a break from 
                    managing the bank for a day to go find things to stabbity stab before she went loopy with boredom.<br>
                    “Hasna been a week yet, but *has* been a few days... I have this gut feeling that something’s wrong.” Nuffin sat on the bank steps as she 
                    had been waitng for Lyri.<br>
                    “Then we should call the hunters and go pick up their trail from when we last got a letter.”<br>
                    “Aye. I will leave you to go fnd something to stabbity stab... will be back soon’s I get ahold of Niquie, and cousins Læurell, Gnawmallie, 
                    and Quyl.. or at least cousin Læurell so she can get ahold of the other two hunters.”<br>
                    “Good idea. See you in a bit, sis.”<br>
                    “Aye. I’m sure you will be glad when Sara’s back again so she can make you cross-ants.”<br>
                    “Will. A’most finished the stack she made me before they left.”
                    <span>*****</span>
                    “Wake up, litle gnomes. I have a plan to get you out of here.” Nyassa was the first to look in the Tauren’s directon.<br>
                    “How d’we know we can trust you?” Ny gave her a suspicious look.<br>
                    “Are you familiar with Chiefain Baine Bloodhoof?”<br>
                    “N’really.”<br>
                    “King Anduin Wrynn?”<br>
                    “Yes.”<br>
                    “Well, King Wrynn used to exchange leters with Chiefain Bloodhoof. And I happen to side with the Chiefain, rather than the Horde leader, 
                    Lady Windrunner.”<br>
                    “So what’s the plan?” Irean asked as all three of them gathered around the Tauren.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Læurell took point, using every tracking skill at her disposal to pick up the mage’s trail. The three rogues melted into the shadows, 
                    spreading a protectve stealth net over the trio of hunters between the three of them. The hunter fnally picked up the trail, and all six 
                    gnomes travelled the path to Brennadam. As they approached the city, Læurell’s wolf gave a growl; the hunter responded by slowing the party 
                    down. She stopped her wolf at the bridge leading into the town, and gawked in horror at the Horde presence on the other side of said 
                    bridge.<br>
                    “Sis?” Gnawm’s voice trailed away as she came abreast of Læurell’s right side; Quyl’s mouth hung open in shock on her lef side. The hunters 
                    were peripherally aware of the rogues cautiously approaching, using shadow cover to get as close as they possibly dared while avoiding 
                    detecton; the quiet nature of their Llothien Prowler fox mounts was especially suited to this type of operaton. Quyl’s gray Admiralty 
                    stallion shifted in place nervously, feeding off the energy of his owner. As if by silent agreement, all three hunters dismounted 
                    simultaneously, Gnawm and Læurell readying their bows while Quyl readied her harpoon. First target: an orc that appeared to be wandering 
                    in the directon of the bridge. Læurell sent Cloudy and Shadow after him alongside Gnawm’s Amethystus, both of them flling him full of 
                    arrows as Quyl harpooned the same target, wading in beside her turtle Aquamarine with polearm swinging. What followed afer was a repeatng 
                    cycle of target picked and atacked, untl the Horde populaton in their closest area of infuence was no longer an issue. The hunters were 
                    peripherally aware that the rogues had been helping take down targets as well; they now joined the hunters in the discussion as to what to 
                    do next.<br>
                    “Need to fnd a commander type, don’t we? See if we can fnd out what happened to the mages?” Nuffin held her blades in defensive positon, 
                    eyes dartng about as she watched for possible threats approaching; the other two rogues mirrored her stance.<br>
                    “Dunno if we’ll get anything out of an orc, but it’s worth a try. Can you rogues spread out and see if you can fnd anybody important-
                    looking, and come back and let us hunters know? Please?” Quyl glanced around, making sure they were stll clear.<br>
                    “On it!” Lyricka and the rest of the rogues melted into the shadows once again.<br>
                    “Quyllie, you wouldn’t by any chance have a spyglass on you would you?”<br>
                    “I would, actually. In me saddlebags. Be right back.” Quyl hurried across the bridge to where the hunter’s mounts waited, retrieving her 
                    spyglass from a bag hanging down from her stallion’s saddle. Scurrying back across the bridge, she handed it to Gnawm, who had made the 
                    request. Gnawm lifed it to her eye afer taking the cover of the other end. Wyverns, zeppelins with bombs... ah!<br>
                    “Say, Læurell, take a look will you? What’s beyond all the wyverns and bomb-totng zeppelins? Do you see it?” She handed the spyglass over. 
                    Læurell let out a litle gasp when she saw it.<br>
                    “Think we could get onto that, Quyllie?” She handed the spyglass back to Quyl, so she could take a look to assess the likelihood of what 
                    she asked.<br>
                    “Well... harpoon’d work.... just need more rope I think... don’t have enough to reach with my current one.” Nufy and the other two rogues 
                    materialized at that moment.<br>
                    “Methinks we found the perfect target. Undead fire mage, a Captain Lockwood by name. We’ve heard whispers among the grunts, and saw him 
                    ourselves.”<br>
                    “Lead the way, Cousin Nuf. Think we might have ourselves a plan.”<br>
                    “I did see the spyglass. What have you found?” Niquie inclined her head towards Gnawm with interest, while stll keeping an eye out for 
                    Horde enemies.<br>
                    “A zeppelin, of course. Quyl says she just needs more rope to get aboard.”<br>
                    “We can fix that!” Afer that, talk was scarce, as they were presented with enemy afer enemy again. At one point, Lyri tapped Quyl’s arm 
                    and pointed; Quyl quickly spotted the mage they were afer through her spyglass, and endeavoured to direct the fghtng gnomes that way. 
                    Finally they arrived at the area where the mage was. Læurell took frst shot, with Gnawm interruptng his frst cast with counter shot; Quyl 
                    harpooned in, the rogues moving in to help with disabling their target. All three hunters pulled their pets of their target when they were 
                    sure he couldn’t atack them or get away. Lyri held her knives at the ready.<br>
                    “Where were the gnome mages taken?”<br>
                    The forsaken spit at her. “The Banshee Queen will have done away with them by now. You’re too late.” Lyricka looked him up and down, 
                    disgusted. She quickly stabbed him in the heart and walked away.<br>
                    “Forsaken are worse than orcs. Apparently Sylvannas has them. Need to move fast. You need more rope right, Cousin Quyllie?” Quyl nodded.<br>
                    “Let’s find some so we can rappel up to that zeppelin and get out of here. We have gnomes to rescue!”
                    <span>****</span>
                    The trip through Brennadam to look for rope proved to be relatvely uneventul; the gnomes easily rappelled up to the zeppelin and took 
                    control. The goblin at the helm was, in fact, quite willing to do as they asked, and set sail for Orgrimmar. The gnomes all took turns 
                    keeping an eye on their goblin helmsman, no mater how helpful he appeared to be; the rest of the gnomes caught up on sleep while one kept 
                    watch. Finally, they sailed into Ogrimmar, the goblin meekly pointng out that they would not be at all welcome, but instead hunted. Gnawm 
                    responded that their plan was to get in, free their fellow gnomes, and get out, as soon as possible. The goblin wished them good luck... 
                    and pointed out an arena where it was assumed any prisoners would be held near. Sylvanus, he admited, was fond of doing her dirty work in 
                    public. He then admited that if there was a way out of the Horde, he would take it, as he wasn’t at all fond of the wiles of their new 
                    leader. The gnomes thanked him for his kindness and helpfulness, then cautously exited the zeppelin, Quyl using her spyglass upon immediate 
                    departure to get a feel for how they were going to get from where they were to said arena.<br>
                    “Time to call the troops, I guess. Makes us less inconspicuous, but probly the best way to get from here to there. AND fastest.” Nufn 
                    called her raven, as did the other two rogues. “Hmm, yes. I think, for this venture, we should double up. Agreed?” Lyri and Niquie nodded 
                    vigorously, but the three hunters looked skeptcal.<br>
                    “Can they actually handle that much weight?” Quyl queried.<br>
                    “Looks like a short hop, so I *think* so.” Niquie replied. Three ravens now hovered at the edge of the rocky precipice, waitng for their 
                    riders to climb on. Læurell carefully balanced herself behind Nufn, while Quyl and Gnawmallie did the same behind Lyricka and Niquie. The 
                    rogues quickly and skillfully guided their mounts to the precipice upon which the arena sat, quickly dismountng both themselves and the 
                    hunters behind them to release the ravens into the skies above.
                    <span>****</span>
                    “It’s time litle ones. Let’s hope this plan works and doesn’t backfire.”<br>
                    “If you please, may I ask your name, Miss Tauren? I would like to count you as a friend, even if this doesn’t work the way it’s supposed 
                    to.” Irean extended her three-fngered hand towards the Tauren. “Us too!” Sara and Ny chimed in.<br>
                    “Of course you would. My name is T’bon Thunderhoof. Pleased to meet you, mages Irean, Nyassa, and Lessära. And now, litle gnomes, let’s see 
                    about getting you all out of here in one piece.” The orcs stomped into the cell, picked up their prisoners, and marched out of the cell 
                    again; Tbon followed like a shadow. The sunlight blinded the gnomes at frst, and they squinched their eyes closed untl they could slowly 
                    open them inch by painful inch. The scene before them was a bit jarring – or at least to Ire it was. Out of the corner of her eyes she 
                    could see Ny’s disgusted face, and Sara’s scowl.<br>
                    “Be brave, litle gnomes. I will do what I can.” T’bon was barely visible in cat form in the shadows of the arena before them. Like any 
                    druid, or rogue, she was using the shadows to cover her movements untl such a tme as she needed to reveal herself. Just as the orcs and 
                    their cargo entered the inner arena entrance, Sylvannas Windrunner congealed out of shadow in the very center; the gnomes cringed back 
                    away from her as one in the hands of their captors as they heard Tbon’s soft animal growl nearby. The Horde crowd caught sight of the 
                    gnomes in the orcs’ grip, and the jeering began. “Citzens of the Horde! I bring you a rare spectacle of gnomes today!” Cheers and jeers 
                    followed her pronouncement. Sylvanus drew her blades. “So, a queston to you of the Horde. Do I deal with them personally? Or... a trusted 
                    pet.” An orc led a black wolf into the arena, letting it prowl the arena afer Sylvanus acknowledged it and its handler. The Horde 
                    spectators, especially the orcs, started cheering with glee while pointng at the wolf wandering the arena. Sylvannas gave a nod to the 
                    spectators, and disappeared in a puff of smoke; the orcs holding the gnomes dropped their tny burdens, backing away to give the wolf a 
                    clear shot at the mages. The gnomes faced the approaching wolf square on, staffs at the ready to fend it of best as they could, having 
                    already determined that their magic was blocked by something or someone in the arena. T’bon’s lashing tail swung in and out of the shadows 
                    where she was hidden, preparing to pounce; more gnomes suddenly dropped into the arena, three sets of knives drawn as three rogues took up 
                    positon between their mage cousins. Three hunters stood a few steps in front, flanked by their pets.<br>
                    “Excellent timing!” Irean had a chance to get out before the gnomes were set upon by the giant wolf. It was all over in a manner of 
                    seconds, thanks mostly to the hunter’s pets; Sylvannas reappeared in a puff of smoke, blades at the ready – the danger was not over yet.<br>
                    “I suppose I should have dealt with you myself to begin with!” Before she could move, a shadow portal spawned itself between the banshee 
                    queen and the gnomes. A night elf stepped out.<br>
                    “Hurry! I can only hold this open for so long!” As the gnomes hurried into the portal, Ire caught the sight out of the corner of her eye 
                    of Sylvannas staring in consternaton and shock. The elf who had created the portal came through on the other side behind them; but they 
                    realized when they took a proper count that they had lost a third of their company.<br>
                    “Where’s Sara? And Gnawm? And Niquie?” Six distraught litle gnome voices questioned where their three comrades had gone. The elf knelt so 
                    she was on eye level.<br>
                    “I.. am sorry. I will go back through the portal to make sure they didn’t get left behind. The only other opton is that they got lost afer 
                    stepping through the portal. That happens sometmes, and I’m sorry to say that if that happened the I don’t know exactly where they went. 
                    And may never find them.” True to her word, the elf stepped back through the portal just before it closed.
                    <span>****</span>
                    “How DARE she defy me! I should have destroyed those litle morsels when I had the chance. Preposterous!” Sylvannas was over her shock, and 
                    enraged that she should see her sister popping out of thing air to help what she viewed as an inferior species. Of course, they were all 
                    inferior species compared to her, regardless if they were related to her or not. Had she not been seething so much, she might have notced a 
                    new portal open in the arena, might have noticed her sister, Alleria, walk out of said portal, look around as if searching for something, 
                    and then, nodding to herself as if satsfed whatever she was looking for wasn’t there, walking back into the portal.
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Sara? Are you seeing this?”<br>
                    “Where – where are we?”<br>
                    “I dunno. Think we be the only ones here though.” Niquie gave a sad sigh.<br>
                    “Aww. Lyri won’t be having any more cross-ants. In fact, I dunno if we’re *ever* gonna see *any* of them again.” Sara voiced her greatest 
                    fear.<br>
                    “Well, I guess if that’s it then we might as well go splorin’. See what we can see. At least we’re together."<br>
                    “At least there’s that, yes. One last grand adventure for all of us.”</p>

                    Læurell fnished tacking up her wolfawk mount for the morning ride, calling her leopard cat Cloudy over to join her once she was mounted. 
                    Frosty, her wolf, sat outside the barn, guarding his territory; white tiger Kuura was stretched out on the porch of the small cabin that 
                    was Læurell’s abode. Shockwave, her stone dragon turtle, was dozing on the shore of her pond, soaking up the sun’s morning rays.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Nuffin directed her raven mount to circle above the forest, looking for a clearing in which to land.<br>
                    Aha! Her bird tipped toward the ground, diving for the clearing, where she tumbled off an outstretched wing tipped towards the ground. She 
                    melted into the shadows as her mount took of again to find a perch in the upper trees somewhere.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Pink ponytails whirled through the air, the gnome whom they belonged to roaring in mock anger against an as of yet unseen foe. Blue eyes 
                    narrowed in concentraton, Noumi practced her spins, kicks, and punches, vanquishing imaginary enemies. Ban-Lu, her armoured tiger mount, 
                    rested just out of sight, waitng patently for her to fnish her morning routne.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Hoofeats broke the morning stllness, slowing as they reached the forest. The white-haired gnome ran a hand down the neck of her black 
                    steed, sliding off after he came to a stop. She headed to her favourite clearing, leaving her horse to graze where he was. She climbed up 
                    on her usual log to watch the sun rise, a sigh of contentment escaping her lips.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Blond-white ponytails bobbed in rhythm with running booted gnome feet, a warrior out on her daily run through the forest. She stopped on a 
                    hill to both catch her breath and strike at imaginary enemies with her twin swords; the blue blades looked reminiscent of those carried in 
                    another galaxy by peacemakers and negotiators, but the resemblance ended there. Dodging, whirling, striking, slicing the air to ribbons as 
                    if it was multiple attackers, she stopped once again to catch her breath, bathed in sweat, her armour squeaking a little due to the 
                    wetness. Morning workout done, she headed further into the forest to investgate the sights, sounds, and smells.
                    <span>****</span>
                    An avian screech echoed through the forest, its owner being an owl-faced looking creature with four legs, one of which leaked blood in a 
                    pool beneath it. A gnome stood nearby, black sprouts streaming out behind her as she cast a healing spell towards her injured mount. Flesh 
                    knit together under the golden aura, the wound sealing itself with the healing energies from the spell. The gnome lowered her head, 
                    murmuring soothing tones to her mount as she leaned against it, restng.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Læurell pointed her mount towards the sound of an animal in distress as soon as she heard it. Hunter she may be, but she was always caring 
                    towards her mounts and pets, making sure their needs were met physically as well as emotionally; even the animals she did kill were used 
                    properly, with no part going to waste. Meat for sustenance, bones for making arrows or needles, hide tanned and used for clothing, or 
                    repairing tack, organs left in a place that would benefit wild carnivores. Hearing an animal in distress was... distressing; her wolfawk 
                    stepped into a clearing, and stopped.<br>
                    “Cousin Lina?” The black-sprouted gnome separated herself from her Seeker mount reluctantly, Læurell thought.<br>
                    “Cousin Læurell? I didn’t expect to see anyone for miles...”<br>
                    Læurell coughed on a laugh. “I live about a quarter mile from here.”<br>
                    Emalina’s brown eyes grew big as saucers. “Oh?” 
                    <span>****</span>
                    Nuffin stepped out from behind a tree, approaching her two cousins. “Lina? What happened to your mount?”<br>
                    Lina’s saucer eyes glistened with tears. “It was awful. An orc wolf handler sicced his wolves on my Seeker, and they were in the process of 
                    trying to rip him to shreds when I got there.”<br>
                    “Why didn’t he fly?”<br>
                    “He was waitng for me.” Lina was looking at the ground, looking disturbed and embarrassed. Nufy rubbed Lina’s back in a comfortng gesture.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Ban-Lu stepped into the clearing, striding to a halt a few feet from the gathering of cousins and Seeker mount. All eyes fastened on Noumi 
                    afer she cleared her throat to get their atenton.<br>
                    “Normally, I don’t really care to make a distincton between Alliance and Horde, but setting wolves on a mount? That’s just reprehensible. 
                    How do we fix this so it never happens again to ANY of us? I know I’m the newest cousin to join the ranks of adventurers in this new land 
                    but...”<br>
                    “She’s right.” All heads swiveled towards the newcomer to the clearing, a white haired gnome.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Irean looked from gnome to gnome. “We’ve been soloing it in this new land, neither knowing nor caring, really, where our cousins are... or 
                    even how they’re doing. I think we need to pull ourselves together and start checking on each other to see if we need help. Heck, if need 
                    be we should group up all together. Safety in numbers right?”<br>
                    Heads were nodding in agreement.<br>
                    “Did somebody call for a tank?”
                    <span>****</span>
                    Tanky stood at the clearing entrance, white-blond hair waving gently in the breeze.<br>
                    “Well, a tank would certainly be appreciated.” Lina gave Tanky a shy smile.<br>
                    “Thank you for the offer Tanky... I have another idea in mind too.” Læurell waited untl she had everybody’s attention. “What if you all move 
                    into my place?” The answer wasn’t a unanimous yes, but Læurell had kind of fgured on that, and so she presented her arguments. “May I ask 
                    the question: how many of you live in the city, have to board your mounts somewhere, and come out here for the peace and quiet it 
                    provides?” Almost all of her cousins raised a reluctant hand. “Wouldn’t you rather have that peace and quiet all the time?”<br>
                    This tme, there was a unanimous “Yes!” from all the gnomes she was talking to. “It’s settled then? I’ll come help you guys move?”<br>
                    “Sounds good.” Irean said, and the rest of them nodded in agreement.</p>

                    (Hearken back to Burning Crusade expansion, where you could pick a Netherdrake mount afer reaching exalted with the Netherwing facton at 
                    max level; corresponding pics on my Facebook account)</i><br>
                    Irean directed her gryphon through the pass of Shadowmoon Valley, aiming for the floatng island beyond. Ensuring she had her Dragonmaw 
                    disguise donned, she descended to the orc camp, having been instructed to seek out an Overseer Mog’hor by name. The brown-skinned orc 
                    received her service papers without quibble, sending her out to kill overmine flayers, mine nethercite ore, gather nether crystals, poison 
                    non-cooperatve peons, and gather netherwing relics. Despite misgivings about poisoning peons and taking out dragonmaw transporters for 
                    relics, the gnome got to work, quite sure the overseer would not tolerate lack of action. Her greatest joy was mining the nethercite ore, 
                    or any ore really. Proving her worth to Mog’hor, she was further tasked with quelling a Murkblood uprising in the mines, as well as killing 
                    creatures in the same mine that were interfering with producton, recovering lost cargo also within the mine, and disciplining disobedient 
                    peons with a booterang that she herself had made under the tutelage of Chief Overseer Mudlump. She felt rather bad about using the 
                    booterang on peons, but it was fun throwing it. Having impressed Mudlump and Mog’hor with all the various skills she demonstrated while 
                    completing the tasks they gave her, Mog’hor decided to step up the pace of her training. He sent her and her mount off to test her flying 
                    skills against masters of flight under his command; she was to learn how to stay on her mount whilst dodging various things being thrown at 
                    her as she stayed on each master’s tail. It was hard work, but well worth it in the long run. There was all kinds of rocks and other debris 
                    floatng around the island, so the flight masters she was supposed to be following never had a shortage of things to throw at her so she could 
                    dodge them. She also got a request from an Illidari Lord Balthas to go gather materials to make a machine called a soul cannon, which he 
                    used to destroy his brother. (Irean surmised that his brother must be awfully nasty for him to want to do that.) Mog’hor sent her out to 
                    kill death shadow agents, thereby disruptng the twilight portal. Things got dicey afer that: Mog’hor tasked her with attacking the Sha’tar 
                    outpost – her allies in Shadowmoon! She agreed under the pretence of telling the Sha’tar outpost leader when she got there; Mog’hor seemed 
                    only too happy to see her go, and she wondered if he suspected. She went straight to Anchorite Ceyla as soon as she got back to the 
                    outpost, quickly detailing to her what had transpired. The anchorite went to gather forces to fght the Dragonmaw Skybreakers that would 
                    arrive when Irean used the flare gun; she also tasked Irean with gathering allies to help. Irean sent message afer message to her allies, 
                    hoping for a swift response, which she got. Ceyla gave the word, and Irean set of a flare to call the Skybreakers. They arrived, and the 
                    battle began. The frst wave arrived, and was dealt with just before the second wave arrived; wave afer wave, untl suddenly there were no 
                    more. Irean sighed in relief that her allies were safe once more, but she stll had trepidaton about going back to Mog’hor. She headed back 
                    to the island, talked to Taskmaster Varkule, and was sent to talk to Mog’hor. Mog’hor proceeded to tell her that she would be promoted by 
                    Lord Illidan Stormrage, and they proceeded to where Illidan was. Unfortunately, Illidan saw through her disguise, and verbally berated 
                    Mog’hor for even thinking of letting her into the ranks of his orcs, nevermind letng her ascend to the current positon she held. Mog’hor 
                    turned on her, but fortunately a dragon, by the name of Netheralku, snatched her from her fate, and flew off. The dragon, disguised as the 
                    orc Yarzil the Merc, flew back to the capital city Shattrath, where she met a dragon in elf from by the name of Barthamas. He thanked her 
                    profusely for saving his race, the Netherwing, and ofered her a gift: she could pick one of the Netherwing, and it would bond with her, and 
                    carry her on further journeys. She was given the choice of onyx, azure, veridian, purple, violet, or cobalt, and she chose onyx... the onyx 
                    Netherwing bowed it’s head to her before allowing her to mount and fly away on its back.</p>

                    Irean hugged the white-haired gnome priest in front of her. “So good to see you, Cousin Kiri! You said you had something to show me?”<br>
                    “Muhuh!” Kirrin turned around. “See?”<br>
                    Irean’s eyes grew large like saucers. “Ooooo!” She exclaimed in surprise and delight. “Prety kites! May I?”<br>
                    “Yes, you may.” Irean walked over to a black kitty mount, presentng it with a three-fngered hand to sniff. The cat gave a cursory sniff; she 
                    moved on to the next cat as it seemed the first was ignoring her.<br>
                    “So, which one would you like, Cousin Renie?” Kirrin asked as she fnished introducing herself to the kites. Irean turned ’round.<br>
                    “You mean, I get to pick one?”<br>
                    “You do!”<br>
                    “O, thank you. Tank *you*!” She turned ’round to study them all again.<br>
                    “May I has the black one, pleases?”<br>
                    “Of course!”<br>
                    “Umm.. d’you think I might be able to bring Miss ‘nae, Cousin Lina, Miss Talley, and Cousin Nuffy to look at ’em?... ‘Cuz I think when they

                    “Muhuh. They are welcome to come see.”<br>

                    “This one is *blue*... it *so* matches my skin!” Talley squealed. “That is, umm...” She trailed off in embarrassment.<br>
                    “Then you shall have it.” Kirrin smiled.<br>
                    “Thank you, Miss Kirrin.” Talley excitedly stroked the cat’s head.
                   <span>****</span>
                    “Kiri!” Emalina’s top sprout bounced as she threw her arms around her cousin-priest.<br>
                    “Lina!... You came to see kitties?”<br>
                    “Well, yeah... but I came to see you too!” Lina’s eyes landed squarely on the yellowy-gold cat; she sucked her breath in.<br>
                    “Want?”<br>
                    “Shall have.” Kirrin smiled. Lina immediately claimed it by placing a bubble shield around it.<br>

                    “Fantastc!” Laurnae exclaimed upon seeing the cats.<br>
                    “Glad you like ’em.” Kirrin watched as ‘nae studied each cat.<br>
                    “Hmmm... I like the green one, but I also like the red one. Hmm.”<br>
                    “Can’t have both. Well, could I s’pose, but they would be competng for your attention.”<br>
                    “Oh, trust me, one cat is quite enough! I’ll take the green one, please.”<br>
                    “Alright.”<br>
                    Emeris watched from the shadows in cat form. “That green cat *will* be mine.” She mutered to herself.

                    Hi, my name is Nuffin Shadowblade. My parents always used to tell me I was born of shadow; they also quite frequently told me that I had 
                    the temper of some Irish humans they met – and the hair and eyes to boot. Ok.. so what does that tell me? Red hair, green eyes, hot temper, 
                    and the ability to be so quiet I can sneak anywhere – oh, and an affinity for hiding in the shadows.<br>
                    Maybe that’s why they named me Nuffin? Cuz I can disappear so easily? Anyway... as I grew older, it was hinted that maybe an apprentceship 
                    as a rogue would be the best idea for a career path. If it meant sneaking, count me in; and that’s how I ended up being brought to Mathias 
                    Shaw in my early teens to see if he, the master spy, could pair me up with a good rogue teacher. And that’s how I ended up here, apprentced 
                    to Kelsey Steelspark. As a fellow gnome, and possibly friend, she’s the best. As a teacher, she’s very tough on you, which is actually a 
                    good thing once you get used to her ways; she says the best way to learn is from experience and getting your hands dirty. She also doesn’t 
                    shirk her duty, nor let you shirk yours. Having said that, she IS willing to take you out into the feld and work side-by-side, so she’s 
                    definitely a hands-on teacher.<br>
                    “Ready for practce, Nuffin? A rogue always needs sharp combat skills!”<br>
                    “Be right there, Miss Steelspark!” This is how the day goes when not out in the field: knife throwing practce, sneaking practce, combat 
                    practice on the target dummies... a day full of actvites meant to sharpen the mind and reflexes. Afer all, we are spies as much as we are 
                    combat experts.. and sometimes assassins, depending on what the job entails. The phrase ‘You saw nuffin!’? Yeah, that wasn’t me who coined 
                    it, though I *have* taken it to heart. She coined it afer I scared the living daylights out of her by sneaking up on her in one of our 
                    training sessions. She went from furious that I scared her, to seriously applauding my ease and prowess at sneaking, to joking with me 
                    about it... and that’s where the phrase appeared to begin with. She’s said on numerous occasions that I’m her best operatve – hintng that 
                    I might even be surpassing her; that I highly doubt, but if I end up being considered an equal, that’s fine by me.<br>

                    “Good morning, fellow rogues. It has come to my attention through a meetng with King Wrynn that we have a situaton developing that requires 
                    our expertse. As such, I would like to send you out in teams two. We will be investgatng the threat of an old god by the name of N’zoth, 
                    so keep your eyes and ears open and trust no one. Any questons?” Kelsey raised her hand, and he motioned to her. “Miss Steelspark?”<br>
                    “Might we be allowed to pick our teammate?”<br>
                    “Of course. Please do. I know I just said trust no one, but I make an excepton here as I trust you all to make the best judgement call in 
                    choosing a teammate.”<br>  
                    “Thank you, sir.”<br>
                    “Any other questons?” I raised my hand.<br>
                    “Miss Shadowblade. I’ve heard you’re the most promising of the new recruits. Glad to have you on the team.”<br>
                    “Pardon me, sir, but is there anything at all we’re looking for?”<br>
                    “As of yet, no idea. Best course of acton is to trust your instncts at this point. If something seems of or wrong, it probably is.”<br>
                    “Thank you, sir.”<br>  
                    “Anyone else?” Silence greeted his queston. “I’ll take that as a no. Alright, people, you have your orders. I want you in teams and heading 
                    out as soon as possible.”<br>
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Nuffin?”<br>
                    “Yes, Miss Steelspark?”<br>
                    “Please, call me Kelsey. I owe you that much afer all the tme we’ve spent together training. In all respects you *are* my equal.”<br>
                    “You owe me? I don’t follow.”<br>
                    “You’ve worked so hard to get to the level of expertise you’re at. And I know I’ve pushed you *hard*. That’s ok, right? I saw so much 
                    potental in you when we frst started...”<br>
                    “Of course that’s ok. How else could I improve?”<br>
                    “So could you do me the small favour of calling me Kelsey? I know it will be hard to begin with.”<br>
                    I gave her a bit of a smile. “I think that can be arranged.”<br>
                    “Good. One more favour? Please?”<br>
                    “Yes?”<br>
                    “Would you mind being my teammate?”<br>
                    “Of course!”</p>

                    Tanky woke up disoriented, blinking up at a mechagnome she didn’t recognize.<br>
                    “Where am I?”<br>
                    “Mechagon. Your cousins brought you here afer you were incapacitated during the last battle.” Tanky raised her hand 
                    – and stared at it in disbelief.<br>
                    “What is this?!”<br>
                    “Your original limbs were damaged beyond repair, we replaced them with beter ones.” The mechagnome showed her a 
                    hologram of a deathly white gnome, arms and legs mangled beyond repair. Tanky gasped.<br>
                    “Is that... me?”<br>
                    “Indubitably. I regret that you were sent to us in such conditon.”<br>
                    “Thank you for your... help.”<br>
                    “If you require further assistance, don’t hesitate to ask.” She gingerly got up and walked away, testng out her 
                    new, unfamiliar limbs. The gnome – er, mechagnone – made her way to the flight path, unsure of how she felt about 
                    her new limbs. Her cousins gathered around her when she reached the fight master.<br>
                    “How d’you feel?”<br>
                    “I.. dunno. Diferent for sure.”<br>
                    “We can help you adjust!” Nuffin piped up.<br>
                    “Uh.. thanks? Sowwy, not zactly in a sociable mood at the moment. I’m kinda depressed.”<br>
                    “Aww. Maybe we can think of something to cheer you up? Or maybe we could sit with you in silent support.” Irean 
                    gave Tanky a sympathetic look. “I’m glad you’re stll alive. To be honest, when we first saw you, we didn’t think 
                    you were.” Her eyes were slightly luminous with unshed tears.<br>
                    “But the mechagnomes made it ok.” Tanky said grudgingly.<br>
                    “I know this wasn’t the best outcome, that you would have rather kept your limbs, but they were kinda beyond repair. 
                    I.. would think you would rather be whole than have no limbs a’tall. You are a warrior afer all... what’s a warrior 
                    without feet to charge and hands to hold your weapons in?” Laurell had her bow nocked in her hands, as close a 
                    demonstraton as she could manage, being a hunter. “Good point. I am thankful for the new limbs... seems easier to 
                    carry my swords around now.”<br>
                    “See? What is there to be depressed about?”<br>
                    “My name doesn’t exactly suit anymore does it? I mean.. TankyTYKE denoted gnome, but I’m not exactly a gnome 
                    anymore.”<br>
                    “Hmm... something similar? Tankete.. YOU? Afer all, when Em’s not around, you fll the role quite well.” Lina pondered 
                    a moment. “I hope this isn’t a rude queston, but how did you end up with the name Tankytyke?”<br>
                    “‘M’parents didn’t know what to name me, untl I started carrying around mock swords as a toddler and startng mock 
                    fights with shadows or anything else that wasn’t... normally part of the house. So, they started calling me a tank 
                    instead of girl or girlie as they had been to that point, and Tankytyke came about when they went visitn’ and realized 
                    that I was on the smallish side even for a gnome.” <br>
                    “You’re stll a gnome y’know. Remember, Erazmin said all mechagnomes are gnomes at heart.” Noumi rested a hand on 
                    ‘ete’s right metal shoulder.<br>
                    “Pardon me?” The gnomish crowd turned around to see Prince Erazmin himself approaching. “I wanted to welcome our 
                    newest mechagnome into our ranks, and offer what support I can give.” Irean stepped out from the crowd of her 
                    cousins. “Thank you, Prince Erazmin, for your offer. I think right now our cousin needs some time, but I’m sure 
                    that when she’s ready she will come looking.”<br> 
                    “Thank you, Miss.. Irean?” The gnome mage nodded. “I will be waitng when she’s ready. Until then, please give her 
                    my best.”<br>
                    “I will. Thank you.” Irean extended her three-fngered hand to Erazmin’s. His mechanical grip was surprisingly 
                    gentle.<br>
                    ‘Ete trained every day to get used to her new arms, going on runs like she always had before the batle. Her 
                    endurance increased as the new arms allowed her to carry the weight more easily. The day came when she was called 
                    to battle again – a flash of fear, followed by a steel determinaton to do the best she could despite the fear. She 
                    would NOT shrink back from her duty. She met her cousins at the Boralus flight path, and they flew over to Mechagon 
                    in a group. They met the rest of the army at the entrance to Mechagon City, quickly breaking into groups: healers, 
                    tanks, ranged, and melee. Erazmin and Gelbin motored in on spider mounts, stopping to survey their troops.<br>
                    “Gnomes and mechagnomes! The time has come to end my father’s reign of terror!” Erazmin’s words were met with a roar 
                    of cheers. “I, Prince Erazmin, and Gelbin Mekkatorque will personally lead the charge. Good luck to us all! For 
                    Mechagon and Gnomeregan!” Erazmin and Gelbin charged into the city’s entrance, followed by the tanks and the melee 
                    groups as the healers and ranged stood back dealing damage and healing, to enemies and troops, respectvely.<br>
                    ‘Ete charged in with the melee group, swords swinging like she always practiced. As the war raged around her, she 
                    could tell when the gnomes were tiring, and stepped in to bolster flagging warriors. All too soon, the battle was 
                    over, and she realized she had surpassed her previous endurance. <i>Wow, these new arms and legs really are 
                    amazing.</i></p>
                    <h1>KITTY VERSE</h1>
                    <h2 id="ninja">Ninja's Fire Scare</h2>
                    <p>Today started like any other day. I got fed, let out, and started hunting. If you know where to look, there are 
                    *so* many things to catch, and half the fun is stalking them before pouncing; your ears tune to that specific sound,
                    your eyes narrow in on the locaton, and you prety much flatten yourself on the ground so your prey doesn’t see you. 
                    The incessant squeaking of what humans call a mouse, the chirping of a bird perched on a limb that’s close enough 
                    for you to take a mighty leap at.. it’s heaven. It was late in the day – I could tell because the bright orb that 
                    keeps me warm during the day was sinking lower and lower and not providing as much warmth – when something happened 
                    that scared the living daylights out of me. I’d notced a pile of wood – heck I’d caught some squeaky toys hiding in 
                    that pile – but then there was this almighty BOOM, and the pile burst into flame. I was terrifed, and took of 
                    running the other way like something was after me – I didn’t want to be near such a noisy, scary place. I ran and 
                    ran and ran, putting as much distance between me and that .. THING before I fnally had to stop running because I was 
                    out of breath, my heart beatng a mile a minute. And then.. wait, where was I? No place I recognized, that’s for 
                    sure! Lost, terrifed – again – this time that I’d never fnd home again... what was I to do? That big scary pile of 
                    flame was probably stll there, no way I wanted to go near THAT; but now that I’d slowed down, I was feeling thirsty, 
                    soo thirsty. I glanced up at the bright ball in the place humans call the sky. Stll there, and making me so very hot.. 
                    and thirsty. I looked around for shade – there was none that I could spot; I flopped down dejectedly on the ground, 
                    not sure what to do next but knowing I was surely lost and not at all sure if I should try to fnd my way back home. 
                    So I waited untl it cooled off. I slowly started heading in the directon I thought home was; nothing looked familiar 
                    to begin with, but as I contnued on, I started to recognize landmarks so I knew I was headed in the right directon. 
                    Trees! So tired, so thirsty.. but trees! Now I knew I was on the right track – progress! I kept going as fast as my 
                    body would allow; I was excited to get home but felt sluggish like I couldn’t go very fast. So I trudged towards home, 
                    putng one paw in front of the other; the bright ball had disappeared, replaced by chilly darkness, but stll, I kept 
                    going, knowing that sooner or later I would get home. Night sounds put me on edge, and I slowed even more, stalking 
                    through the night silently like only my kind can, seeking to avoid contact with anything else. The bright ball up 
                    high came back, warming my chilled body as I contnued to trudge in the directon of home – thankfully I now had trees 
                    to duck under for shade when it got too hot. *Finally* I spoted the building I called home, where I took shelter at 
                    times when that bright ball in the sky got too hot. The human called Mom found me sprawled on a concrete pad at the 
                    back of the house, took me in, offered me some water, and put me on my favourite box in the downstairs of the house, 
                    where I could look out the window if I wanted too. So tired I didn’t even bother, just stayed on the box, content to 
                    doze for a good long while. My favourite human called Laura came to visit me and gently peted me a bit before leaving 
                    me in peace. I was glad to be home.</p>
                    <h2 id="squee">Squee's New Home</h2>
                    <p>It was so much fun exploring the outdoors with my siblings, climbing trees, chasing each other, just running 
                    around in the grass that grew there. So why it had to come to a crashing end I have no idea; we were visited here 
                    and there by two youngsters of the same species as the ones who raised us, and I kinda had the feeling they would 
                    have taken us all away if they could, but that, I think, would have been just as bad as what did happen. This lady 
                    came to see us, and she was very interested in me; I was enjoying the attention, but glad when she fnally put me 
                    back with my siblings. Two others came with the lady, too; one of them smelled similar to those taking care of us, 
                    while the other had traces of the same smell. I was to learn that this was the beginning of my separaton from my 
                    siblings, though I didn’t know it then.<br>
                    The trip ‘home’ – time has no meaning for cats like us – not like humans. We eat when our tummies say we’re hungry, 
                    we sleep when we’re tired, we play when we have bursts of energy...I can’t tell you exactly how long or how short 
                    the time was to the next visit that the people that smelled similar to our caretakers was, all I know is that I was 
                    taken away from my siblings and never saw them again – or at least not in the same light anyway. I was picked up, 
                    placed on a lap, and stayed there the whole trip – might have even fallen asleep for a bit. The trip there wasn’t 
                    unpleasant, but it was rather jarring to be introduced to a new environment, minus all my siblings. I was put in a 
                    room, why I don’t know, and I protested... loudly. I escaped first chance I got – but wait, who was this? Not one 
                    of my siblings, for certain, but it was certainly another of my species; at that moment I didn’t really care. I 
                    hissed at him, and hissed back at me; I was mad – how DARE they take me away from the only family I knew and drop 
                    me in a strange place, with a stranger? I was closed in the room again, unhappy and confused. Time wore on, and I 
                    got to meet this other member of my species, this tme having decided to make the best of my situaton.<br>
                    “Who are you?”<br>
                    “I am Duke Mal of Lafond Manor. Perhaps I can assist you in acclimatizing to your new home, if you wish.”<br>
                    “Don’t suppose there’s any way of getng back to my family.”<br>
                    “Unfortunately, that’s not possible. I understand your reaction to me last tme, it must be a shock.” <br>
                    “Yes, well, I’ve decided to make the best of it, so I would appreciate your help in getng acclimatized. I’m 
                    Princess Squee Foxtail, by the way.”<br>
                    “I suppose I’m your new companion. Our caretakers are nice, so there is that; unless I get stressed out and pee 
                    on something that they use.” I rubbed on him in thanks for the informaton, deciding I might as well be nice to the 
                    current resident of this, my new home, according to him.<br>
                    “Well, then, let me show you around, Litle Miss Squee. The room you are in now is called the bathroom, across the 
                    hallway from there is the bedroom; down the hallway here is the kitchen – my favourite room in the whole house, as 
                    I get fed there and can sometmes find snacks on the floor. Down the stairs is the basement – good for cooling of 
                    when it’s hot and stuffy up here. Oh, and I forgot to tell you about the room past the bathroom on the same side – 
                    that one’s called the office.”</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 1: Planetfall</h3>
                    <p>Micha peered over his shoulder to assess the condition of his fellow travelers; to a being, they were tired, 
                    struggling to keep their wings flapping to maintain the precious foot of space between them and the water below. A 
                    colossal blue head broke the surface, followed by an even bigger shell. The bronze Vorum started circling to land, 
                    leading the rest of them to a landing on the shell. Upon landing, he began issuing orders.<br>
                    “Ashir? Guard the herd while I’m gone. Galen, you’re with me. We’re going to patrol to see what else, if anything, 
                    lives here. Everyone else, stay here; we should be back soon.” Micha cantered away with Galen not far behind. Ashir 
                    huffed a sigh.<br>
                    “Ok everyone. You have permission to forage for food and rest, but make sure that in your wanderings you stay 
                    within sight of each other. If someone should see something they’re not sure of, either come tell me, or call me 
                    over. Okay?” Mumbles and nodded assents met her statement, and she looked around for higher ground from which to 
                    watch the herd.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    “What exactly do you expect to find here Micha?”<br>
                    The bronze being swiveled his head to look at his companion. “Nothing really. Never hurts to check though, does
                    it?”<br>
                    “True. What exactly did our Commander say to you before we came here?”<br>
                    “His exact words were: ‘I want you to set up a safehaven for sometime in the future.’ He also told me we were to 
                    hide our true nature until an appointed time.”<br>
                    Galen stared at the silver sea. His sharp eyes caught sight of clumps of stuff floating in the water. “Hmm, I 
                    wonder what that is.” He swung his head toward Micha.<br>
                    “Hmm.” The bronze pawed at the clump that was closest. His shoulders shuddered in a shrug. “I’m sure we’ll find out 
                    sooner or later.” He took a look around again, neck twisting back and forth to take in the scenery. “Alright, I’m 
                    satisfied for now. Let’s get back to the herd.” Micha turned back towards where the herd was, using his floating 
                    trot to cover ground while conserving energy.<br>
                    “Find anything?” Ashir descended from her cliff-like lookout carefully, asking the question on the way down to 
                    where Micha and Galen were.<br>
                    “Nothing, thankfully.” Micha briefly rested his neck on Ashir’s before dropping his head to graze. “What is this 
                    stuff?” He said around a mouthful.<br>
                    “It appears to be the only vegetation around. You get used to it after a few bites.” Micha eyed the vegetation 
                    closely, noting how it grew in scraggly tufts; it reminded him of cat hair, actually. As did the fuzzy feeling in 
                    his mouth when he grabbed bites of it. He heaved a sigh, and continued cropping the fuzzy moss as it was the only 
                    food available.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Ashir saw to it that the rest of the herd was bedded down for the night before joining Micha on a hill overlooking 
                    the area.<br>
                    “So, what did you see out there?”<br>
                    “The usual, for the most part. Except for a clump of stuff – actually quite similar to the vegetation on this land 
                    – floating in the water.”<br>
                    “That’s...interesting.”<br>
                    “Agreed. I’m very curious as to what this stuff is. We’ll have to keep an eye out.” “Indeed. Thank you for the 
                    head’s up.”<br>
                    The hot white sun woke the herd the next morning. Micha reluctantly opened his eyes, not really wanting to get up; 
                    the next second, however, his eyes popped wide open to the sight that met them. Stands of trees covered some of 
                    the fuzzy plains from last night.<br>
                    Micha?<br>
                    Are you seeing what I’m seeing? He shook his head, suddenly realizing that he wasn’t verbalizing. “Trees?”<br>
                    “So you are seeing what I’m seeing.”<br>
                    “Yes.”<br>
                    “And you just...”<br>
                    I did.<br>
                    The two equinids ambled over to join the rest of their herd, sniffing a tree in it’s entirety as high as their noses 
                    would go. The trunk was smooth; no chance of relieving bodily itches from there. The grey colour of the bark was a 
                    little bit shiny, like some metal or mineral substance, but the smoothness of the trunk felt almost fuzzy.<br>
                    Ashir stood on the shore, gazing out on the silver water. Sorely tempted to go for a swim, she extended her right 
                    foreleg to paw at the liquid. Bending her black head, she watched silver droplets run down the hoof, reach the end, 
                    and stretch towards the body of water until they fell in. The black head twisted to the side at the sound of hooves 
                    approaching; Micha came to a straight-legged halt beside her.<br>
                    “Galen is keeping watch.” He pointed his muzzle at the water while eyeing her. “Shall we?”<br>
                    She stretched her muzzle to touch his in answer. Together they bounded forward, plunging through the silver 
                    liquid.<br>
                    Micha took the lead, swimming deeper down into the water with Ashir following; the water shone like silver glass. 
                    Upon looking up, the equinids could see the giant flippers of their turtle island; oddly enough, neither of them 
                    were short of breath, as they expected to be after so long swimming in the oceanic depths. Looking down, they 
                    spotted a spherical whirlpool, which they assumed was the very center of the liquid planet.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Shall we visit other islands? She thought at the bronze beside her. They altered course as one, aiming for the next 
                    closest turtle island; silver water splashed upward as two equine bodies broke the surface. Leathery bat wings 
                    snapped open as the two equinods launched them skyward, aimed for the back of the turtle. Micha landed a step behind 
                    Ashir, and together they went to investigate.<br>
                    As the water world lost its warmth to a setting sun, the rasp of leathery wings was heard coming closer an closer 
                    to the blue turtle island where the rest of the herd resided. Ashir and Micha dove into a running landing a few 
                    yards from the rest of the equinoids, pulling up just short of running into the closest herd member. The rest of 
                    the herd closed in around them, asking many questions.<br>
                    “Where did you go?” Asked a yearling stallion with a silver coat.<br>
                    “We went for a swim.” Micha answered. “It’s so clear all the way to the center of this world, like it’s made of 
                    silver glass.”<br>
                    “And the other islands?” Galen asked. “Did you investigate them?” Ashir nodded, and he asked, “How do they compare 
                    to ours?”<br>
                    “The turquoise moss – or I think it’s moss – is everywhere. The trees we see here? Same thing with the other islands 
                    – or at least the few we were able to investigate before the sun started going down.”<br>
                    “Here is as good a place as any to bed down tonight. I will take first watch. Ashir?”<br>
                    Second watch? The black equine took her job as lead mare seriously, and started helping the mares and foals bed down 
                    by finding the perfect spots for each and every one of them while Micha set the stallions and colts one year and older 
                    as sentries scattered around the herd’s fringes. Then he took off to find a higher vantage point where he could 
                    oversee the herd from above, leaving them in Ashir and Galen’s capable hooves.<br>
                    Ashir took over the vigil from Micha in the darkness before dawn. All seemed quiet, the black mare thought; she must 
                    be extra vigilant though. A dusty blue moon peeked out behind charcoal clouds; her eyes were drawn to an onyx and 
                    silver movement cast in blue as Farin, a three year old stallion, bent his head close to a sapphire Appaloosa mare 
                    spotted with emerald by the name of Sahara. Ashir gently shook her head, smiling at the sight. Young love. The 
                    stallion moved away, heading back to his vigil at the herd outskirts.<br>
                    Micha was the first one up the next morning, moving out to check the perimeter of the herd and confer with his younger 
                    counterparts. In his wanders, he ambled over to the trees that had shown up yesterday. They looked... different 
                    somehow. Or some of them, anyway. There! A branch at eye level... his muzzle mouthed the branch, finding fuzzy 
                    leaves... and something a little harder. What IS that? It felt like a fuzzy little ball – not very big as of yet, but 
                    definitely there.<br>
                    Ashir? The black mare headed his direction; she investigated the branch too, once he showed her. She curled her lip in 
                    a hmm expression, tossing her head in a shrug. It would require further watching.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Micha and Galen continued investigating the islands, leaving Ashir to her lead mare duties. Each island they visited, 
                    they found more of the same – fuzzy vegetation, trees seemingly made up of the same vegetation, and nodules on tree 
                    branches like he’d found on the island the herd resided on. This would require further watching indeed.<br>
                    Galen accompanied Micha on his morning stroll to the trees. The bronze once again explored the nodule... it felt like 
                    it doubled in size overnight! He requested his golden buckskin companion go get Ashir, which was duly accomplished, and 
                    she agreed that there was a sizeable increase. All three of them also noticed a slight change in colour – this 
                    particular one was a bit silver in hue. Interesting. Micha continued to fly out to other islands, with either Galen or 
                    Ashir accompanying, and discovered more of the same features of their own island – trees, mossy vegetation ground 
                    cover, some trees with nodules on them, either silver or gold hued, and some trees with none.<br>
                    Each day, more islands were visited, revealing more moss ground cover, more trees, more knobs that were growing 
                    exponentially in size with gold and silver hues taking over the initial turquoise colour. He managed to pry one off 
                    its branch when it was fully silver; the outside was fuzzy, like the tree it grew off of, but inside it was a rich, 
                    juicy berry mix flavour, like a compilation of all the berries that grew on planet Earth mixed into one, only more 
                    flavourful. He was later able to also sample a gold one, as well, and discovered it had a milk chocolate taste, as rich 
                    and full of chocolate taste as the silver one had been with berry taste.<br>
                    Ashir was the first one to taste the fruit after Micha sampled it, and told him flat out that they were both excellent 
                    in taste, though she slightly preferred the chocolate one over the berry one, just because it was chocolate. They 
                    talked it over and decided it was time to visit the planet’s centre; Galen stayed behind to watch the herd, and the 
                    lead stallion and his mare duly set out, diving into the silvery glass water towards the swirling mass they’d seen the 
                    first day. The hardest part was getting past the whirlpool part; once inside, the centre was divided into bubbles with 
                    thin walls. Rainbowy colours refracted off the walls in truly magnificent display; Micha found himself reluctant to 
                    leave, as did Ashir when he asked her. They finally pulled themselves from the mesmerizing colours, heading out once 
                    more into the perilous whirlpool beyond; the herd was spell bound when the two equinoids returned with the story, and 
                    made them promise to make a trip down together.</p>
                    <h2 id="fire">Wave Riders: Safety - Firewall</h2>
                    <h3>Chapter 2: Firewall</h3>
                    <p>The onyx mare moved more slowly these days due to pregnancy; Micha had had to request the help of another mare 
                    of the herd to help her see to her lead mare duties, as it was getting harder for her to get around quickly because 
                    of being near full term.<br>
                    “I will be happy to see you, little one, when you finally grace this world with your presence.” She spoke to her 
                    belly in a tired, affectionate voice. “Hopefully soon.”<br>
                    The bronze stallion swung up alongside her, checking on her again as he did many times a day. They touched noses, 
                    and then Micha touched her belly. She slowly laid down, groaning softly as the effort took its toll. Micha moved 
                    ff to talk to Galen about the nighttime watch, leaving his mate in the middle of the scattered herd; Sahara the 
                    emerald spotted sapphire mare sidled up to Ashir.<br>
                    “Rest well, Matron. The herd is in good hooves. I will keep watch for you so you can rest.” “Thank you, Sahara. 
                    This little one grows heavier every day.”<br>
                    “Oh, but he or she will be such a joy once born.”
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Water splashed on the grass around midnight; Sahara rushed over as she had been close enough to hear it while 
                    making her rounds.<br>
                    “The baby?”<br>
                    “Please, get Micha.” Ashir was already panting as contractions ripples across her belly; her legs buckled as she 
                    tried to move into a more comfortable position, rolling her on her side. Micha arrived to find her grunting as she 
                    pushed through the contractions; he carefully stepped around to her rear end. “Halfway there!” The head, front 
                    feet, and shoulders lay on the grass. She kept pushing until the sack- encased foal lay on the grass behind her. 
                    She lumbered to her feet, swinging around to start licking the sack off her foal. Micha joined her in uncovering 
                    their baby, proud of his mate’s work.<br>
                    “A fine foal.”<br>
                    “It’s a boy.” Ashir’s eyes met his. “Nemir. You approve?”<br>
                    “A fine name.”
                    <span>*****</span>
                    The onyx bay colt gambolled around his mom, hiding under her tail periodically and peeking out like he was shy. 
                    She chuckled.<br>
                    “Silly. Why don’t you go play with the other foals? I know you’ve been eyeing a certain filly...”<br> 
                    “She batted an eyelash at me.”<br>
                    “Well then, you need to confront her, son.” Micha had his head lowered so his muzzle pointed at his son.<br>
                    “Really Daddy?”<br>
                    “She flirted with you. It’s up to you to return the favour.” The bronze winked at his son.<br>
                    “Well, go on.” Ashir gently nudged him in the bum; he scampered off. “Imagine that, he’s already found his mate.” 
                    Micha teased.<br>
                    “He’s too young for that yet. But they can still play.”<br>
                    “Indeed.”
                    <span>*****</span>
                    The foals grew like weeds as the last of spring transitioned into summer. One month later, the coolness of spring 
                    gave way to the heat of summer, scorchlingly hot; the moss crackled under hoof as the herd moved upon it, grazing. 
                    The filly in question who had flirted with Nemir, a silver bay with onyx muzzle, tail, and lower legs, seemed to 
                    most often gravitate to playing with – and chasing – Nemir, who gleefully chased her back, round and round in 
                    circles; until, that is, the very moss under their feet erupted in flames, scattering the herd in all directions. 
                    They quickly regrouped, fleeing the spreading flames.<br>
                    “To the water!” Micha shouted, wheeling the herd toward the shores of the island. The crackling flames added 
                    urgency to their flight, but for some of the younger foals it was still too much as the fire spread and nipped at 
                    their heels. Nemir stumbled and crashed to the ground; quick as he could he scrambled back up and kept going, even 
                    as his mother circled back around to help him. Finally, the herd splashed into the water; Micha circled, assessing 
                    their condition. His son had patches of singed hair, as did a lot of the other younger foals – he was shaken by 
                    the sight, but glad that none of them were any worse.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    The fire burned through the night, wiping the island clean; the foals huddled as near to the shore as they could 
                    without getting even more singed than the youngest ones already were. The adults treaded water farther out, one of 
                    them periodically launching into the air on a fly about of the island. Upon return, each one reported no life, not 
                    even a tuft of fuzz. Instead, there was black char where the moss and trees had been.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    When morning came, the mares and foals were released back on the island as the fire had died. Micha split the 
                    stallions into teams of two, sending them out to check the other islands. One after another they came back, 
                    reporting nothing left but charred blackness on the back of each turtle island.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Shortly after the herd re-inhabited the island, Micha happened to notice a tuft of the fuzzy moss floating near 
                    the island as he was circling to land coming back from a flyby of the next nearest island. Though he thought it 
                    was mildly interesting, that’s as far as his thoughts went; apparently the moss floating on the water didn’t suffer 
                    the same fate as the moss on land. He did mention it in passing to Ashir and Galen, and they thought it was mildly 
                    interesting as well, but only mildly. The herd bedded down for the night on the scorched ground, trying to get 
                    comfortable by shifting around in the cinders on the ground.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Ashir woke the next morning to a persistent tickle at her belly – come to think of it, all over her body where it 
                    met the ground. She opened her eyes to realize she was surrounded by turquoise moss. Micha?<br>
                    I see it. Looks like it grew back overnight. The bronze stallion landed a few feet away as Ashir lurched to her 
                    feet.<br>
                    “Nemir?”<br>
                    “Playing with the other foals nearby. Sahara is keeping watch.”<br>
                    “We need to find a better refuge for the foals. Something tells me this might happen again.” “I agree. Considering 
                    how fast this moss went up in flames...”<br>
                    “I think Galen is the best choice for that don’t you think?”<br>
                    “I was thinking along the same lines. I’ll tell him when we discuss watch rotation.”
                    <span>*****</span>
                    “I would like to ask a favour, Galen. Both Ashir and I feel that the moss might go up in flames again, and we 
                    would like to have a better place for the foals to stay than the water should this happen again. Besides Ashir, 
                    you I trust the most, so may I give you the job of finding such a place?”<br>
                    “Of course. I will do the best I can.”<br>
                    “Thank you.”
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Galen began his search for a safe haven the next morning. He took off for distant mountains, hoping he could find 
                    a cave big enough. He approached the mountains from the ground first, climbing up the tree line until any 
                    vegetation was no more, making sure that a fire could not trap the foals; he found many caves, but none big enough 
                    to house even one foal, let alone many. As the sun started going down, he bedded down in front of the last cave 
                    he’d investigated.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Next day, he took off flying, being blocked by paths too steep for him to travel on hoof. Many diving pit stops, 
                    many caves, but still none big enough to house the herds youngest members. He stamped his hoof in frustration. 
                    This might take awhile. He thought. He kept circling, checking out each outcropping in hopes of finding the perfect 
                    cave.

                    The blue sun rose, casting an azure tinge on the onyx pointed golden bay horse circling the mountains. He had 
                    checked many mountains, stuffed his head and even almost his whole body into many caves... none big enough to hold 
                    more than one or two foals. This, the last mountain, he hoped would hold the refuge for them, the third sized and 
                    up versions of him and all his friends and family of the herd. “Mighty Maker, may I find refuge for our little ones 
                    here.” He circled the peak, diving towards the first outcropping he saw. The cave he found could barely fit his 
                    head, let alone his body. He took off again, methodically circling lower and lower, checking each outcropping he 
                    found.</p>
