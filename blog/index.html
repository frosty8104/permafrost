                    (Time period: Batle for Azeroth)</i><br>
                    (One month before Irean Icebolt’s birthday...)<br>
                    “Greetngs, Master Alcorn. Might I inquire how much that beautiful black horse in the nearby stables is?”<br>
                    “Ten thousand gold, Miss.”<br>
                    “Ah, thank you.” Læurell watched her cousin carefully, saw the slight shoulder drop of dejecton. Aha! Finally, the 
                    perfect present.. if only she could raise the money somehow.<br>
                    “Ahoy, Miss hunter?”<br>
                    “Yes, Master Alcorn.”<br>
                    “Been seeing you around a lot. How are things going in the huntng business? With them witches around I’d imagine 
                    it’s a litle tough.”<br>
                    “Oh, my pets handle them just fne. And I’m also fairly handy with a bow, so they don’t really last that long between 
                    the two of us.”<br>
                    “Glad to hear it. I’m glad Lady Waycrest is around, else I’d be thinking of picking up and moving, with all that’s 
                    going on here.”<br>
                    “Stay safe, Master Alcorn.”<br>
                    “You as well, Miss...?”<br>
                    “Læurell Gearbow, sir.”
                    <span>****</span>
                    “So, what’s this meetng about, Cousin Læurell?” Nuffin was the frst cousin bold enough to ask why the hunter had called all her cousins, 
                    except Irean, together.<br>
                    “I’ve seen Cousin Irean eyeing the black chargers for sale out in Drustvar, and I had a thought. She *really* wants one, because when she 
                    and I were questing in Drustvar, she asked the Quartermaster how much it was, and she was quite disappointed afer hearing it would cost 
                    ten thousand gold.”<br> 
                    “Okay. So somehow or other we have to get that much together to get her that horse then.” Emalina surmised.<br>
                    “If possible, aye.”<br>
                    “Well, we defnitely have our work cut out for us then. We should visit the bank frst.”
                    <span>****</span>
                    “How much gold have you?” Nuffin popped out of the shadows closest to Læurell, making her jump.<br>
                    “You scared me!”<br>
                    “Sowwy.”<br>
                    “Three thousand. And I will take two of that.”<br>
                    “M’ok.. I can contribute that much as well.” Nufy asserted. “And me!” Lina piped up.<br>
                    “And me!” Tanky echoed.<br>
                    “Me too!” Noumi said.<br>
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Hello, Master Alcorn.”<br>
                    “Hello, Miss Gearbow.”<br>
                    “I have here ten thousand gold to purchase a Smoky Charger. If I could have it delivered in a month’s time to a farm about a quarter mile 
                    north of Stormwind. If you have never been there, send a mail to me and I will meet you to guide you.”<br>
                    “Thanks for the ofer, but I think I will be fine travelling there. Does anyone in those parts know about your farm?”<br>
                    “Aye, you could probably ask anyone in Elwynn Forest or Stormwind for the hunter gnome’s abode and they will point you to it. I.. kind 
                    of... supply the leather thereabouts. I hunt often.”<br>
                    “Ah. Very good then. I will be sure to do that. There is a dock in Stormwind is there not?”<br>
                    “Aye, there is.”<br>
                    “Well then, I will see you in a month.”
                    <span>****</span>
                    Læurell peered around the corner. O good, her cousins were stll keeping Irean busy with gifts and such. A muffled knocking sounded behind 
                    her, and she turned to go answer the door before her white-haired mage cousin started to get an inkling that somebody was at the door. She 
                    quietly opened the door and just as quietly closed it behind her.<br>
                    “Hi. I’m Læurell, the gnome who talked to you a few days ago. Is it here?”<br>
                    “Aye, it be here, lass. Heck of a time I had of getting here.”<br>
                    “Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. There will be a very excited gnome when she sees the present we got her though.”<br>
                    “Well, I’m glad to hear that. I’m off.”<br>
                    “Thank you very much, Quartermaster Alcorn. Are you sure you can’t or wouldn’t like to stck around to watch us surprise her?”<br>
                    “Afraid I can’t, Miss Læurell. Other deliveries to make. Be sure to give the birthday gnome my best, aye?”<br>
                    “Thank you! I will!”
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Okay, Cousin Renie, one last gift. You have to close your eyes for this one. And let me guide you. No peeking!” Læurell placed her hands 
                    on Irean’s arms from behind, gently pushing her forward towards the door. Emalina held it open, winking at the hunter as she pushed the 
                    white haired mage out of the house, guiding her over the path to the stables.<br>
                    “Ok, you can open your eyes now. Look up!” The mage blinked her blue eyes, tilted her head up, and gasped.<br>
                    “How did you...?!” A black horse head descended to whufe the mage’s hair.<br>
                    “We cousins pooled our gold to get you your own mount. I know we can all choose from any mount in the stables, but we know you’ve been 
                    eyeing a certain horse from the new lands...”<br>
                    “‘E’s beautiful! Thank you, thank you, thank you!” Tears glistened in her eyes. “Best present EVER!”
                    <span>****</span>
                    A spectral wolf howled at the moon; a black armoured cat stepped out of the shadows, and they nodded to each other 
                    before the cat shifed to stag form, the ghost wolf transforming to a Draenei as she leapt onto the druid’s back. 
                    Thundering hooves and pattering feet sounded behind them; a white haired gnome on a black horse led the charge, 
                    followed by a brown haired gnome on a tan wolf accompanied by a smaller white wolf, a red haired gnome on a fox, a 
                    black haired gnome on a owl - faced creature, a white ponytailed gnome on an armoured manasaber, and a black-
                    ponytailed gnome on a white-striped cat. The stag bounded afer them as they passed, heading of on a nightme 
                    adventure.</p>

                    PROLOGUE<br>
                    “Ok, sweet litle baby girl, it’s time for bed I think.” Lunasea Lightningbolt gently placed baby Irean in her crib, lightly wrapping her in 
                    a blanket of lightning tendrils. Leaving the sleeping baby, Luna gently closed the door to the nursery and meandered over to the kitchen, 
                    where her husband was just fnishing up his dessert.<br>
                    “She fell asleep, now she’s in her crib, and we have some alone time.”<br>
                    “Wonderful news, darling.” Phinnly Pyrogear swooped his wife up in his arms, and carried her off to their bed.<br>
                    “I do hope Irean’s sleeping ok.” Luna turned over to face her husband. “I worry when she’s not in my sight.”<br>
                    “I’m sure she’s fine, honey.”<br>
                    “Maybe I should check on her.”<br>
                    “For the sixth tme? She’s fine! And you’d do well to attend to me instead of worrying about her.” Luna lay a long time in bed worrying, 
                    long afer Phinnly fell asleep; finally, she fell asleep too. Worries about her daughter chased her through her dreams, so it was a fitul 
                    sleep, but at least she did get some.<br>
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Luna checked on Irean the next morning, finding a wide eyed baby gnome watching her every move.<br>
                    She reached into the crib to pick her litle girl up, and her hands jerked back as she felt searing cold. Irean was still watching her, her 
                    expression one of curiosity – but she was now encased in a layer of ice. Luna was familiar enough with using ice block herself to know that 
                    this was exactly what was happening. This new development was... interestng, as Irean had never manifested any magical powers untl now.<br>
                    <span>*****</span>
                    TEN YEARS LATER...<br>
                    Irean kept her eyes focused on the two gnomes facing the line she was in, listening for when they called her name.<br>
                    “Nyassa Firespark.”<br>
                    “Here!” For a second, Irean eyed the brown haired gnome beside her, quickly returning her gaze to those who were taking, as she’d heard the 
                    term, “roll call”.<br>
                    “Irean Icebolt.”<br>
                    “Here.”<br>
                    “Hi there! I live in Ironforge. You?” Nyassa eyed her with interest.<br>
                    “I was sent here from Gnomeregan... all I ‘member was that I used to wake up encased in an ice block. Mom and Dad didn’t know what to do 
                    with me, so they sent me to Mistress Bink to see if she could do anythin’. They’re friends, y’know.” Irean was studying the floor, rather 
                    embarrased.<br>
                    “O!... Well, I’se fire mage. I like to burn things.” Nyassa grinned at her. “I can show you around, if you like.” Ny paused. “You have prety 
                    hair, by the way. Speckled brown and white the way it is...”<br>
                    Irean looked up. “I’d like that please. And thank you... Mistress Bink said it might turn all white. I don’t know much about it but sounds 
                    like my ‘frosty outbursts’ as she called ’em seem to be doing that.” “Really?”<br>
                    “Muhuh.”<br>
                    “We has free tme now. Shall I start giving you a tour?”<br>
                    “Yes, please!”<br>
                    Nyassa was true to her word, introducing Irean to every nook and cranny she knew about in Ironforge.<br>
                    “So, we mages live in the Mystc Ward, along with paladins. This door to my left opens into the Forlorn Cavern, where rogues and warlocks 
                    are quartered. Mistress Bink says the warlocks practice darker arts than we mages do, and generally recommends avoiding them as much as 
                    possible.”<br>
                    “Have you ever met a rogue?”<br>
                    “N’really. They be sneaky, so most tmes y’don’t notice them.”<br>
                    “Oh.”<br>
                    “Next to the cavern is the Hall of Explorers where the Explorers League people are when they’re not out exploring. Next to that is my 
                    favourite place to go when we have tme of from magical studies: Tinker Town. They have so many neat gadgets! I usually blink through the 
                    Great Forge to get there... going through the cavern makes me nervous. Other side ‘o Tinker Town is the Military Ward, where warriors spend 
                    their time – been there once once but they’re awfully strict there, an’ I don’t like it, so I tend to avoid it. To my right is the Commons, 
                    where there’s a bank for putting all your valuable stuff in, and an inn for travellers to stay in when visitn’. And that completes the 
                    circle around the Great Forge. So, where would you like to go frst?”<br>
                    “H’bout Tinker Town?” Ny’s eyes lit up at the suggeston, and off they blinked towards a hallway to the Forge.</p>
                    <h2 id="clean">Cleaning Day</h2>
                    <p><i>Disclamer: WoW and all its components (Gnome, Draenei, etc.) are copyright Blizzard.<br>
                    (Time period: Batle for Azeroth)</i><br>
                    Irean Icebolt made a disgusted face when she peeked at the laundry tub that her cloth armour was in. Pink soapy water swirled with bits of 
                    dirt and vegetaton.<br>
                    “Something wrong, cousin Renie?” Emalina approached from behind.<br>
                    “Don’ like cleaning day.” She pointed at the tub in front of her in emphasis.<br>
                    “O. That.” Lina’s fat voice gave evidence to the fact that she, too, didn’t like cleaning day.<br>
                    Irean carefully picked out her armour pieces, dumping the dirty water before motoning her water elemental to use its waterbolt to refll 
                    it.<br>
                    “Need another bucket, Lina? Or would you be okay with sharing?” Lina sidled closer to the tub, assessing its size.<br>
                    “Seems big ‘nuf to share. Thank you, cousin Ire.” Lina dumped her dirty armour in the tub, and both gnomes set to scrubbing the stained 
                    cloth untl it was as clean as they could make it.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Emryss Shadowstep dumped her leather armour on the table to go gather cleaning implements.<br>
                    Noumi rolled into the building and started shucking her armour of in preparaton for cleaning it; she glanced over at Em as Nuffin came in to 
                    take her armour off in preparaton for cleaning.<br>
                    “Such a chore is cleaning day.” Noumi Ohmist said, shaking the leather pieces out of as much dust as she could.<br>
                    “Maybe if you stopped rolling everywhere it would be less dirty?” Nuffin Shadowblade teased; Noumi stuck her tongue out at her cousin.<br>
                    “Gnomes. Just like children.” Emryss rolled her eyes at the ceiling. “I pray Elune has more patence than I do.” The gnomes darted glances 
                    at her, visibly frightened. She grimaced. “I promise not to go feral on either of you. Let us do a thorough job of cleaning this 
                    armour.”<br>
                    The gnomes and the night elf got to work, scrubbing at their armour with dampened cloths rubbed in soap made for leather. As clean as the 
                    armour could be, it glinted where the sunbeams hit.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Frost wolf Frosty sat watching his master and friend as she set to work cleaning her mail armour, teasing out blades of grass, polishing 
                    dirt away, scrubbing at blood stains; Talley Wolfrunner stopped her own armour cleaning to watch the gnome for awhile.<br>
                    “You have a gift, nimble-fnger Læurell.”<br>
                    “Thank you, Miss Talley. Cousin Renie noticed that as well. I'm embarrassed to say I never thought much of it.” Talley turned back to her 
                    own armour.<br>
                    “Well, now you know it is a gift. And you will use it, yes?”<br>
                    “Thank you, Miss Talley, I will.” The Dranei shaman returned to cleaning her armour, sneaking glances every so ofen at her gnome hunter 
                    friend. “I would like to request your help when you are finished with your armour, Miss Laurell.”<br>
                    “Of course! Happy to help.” Laurell darted a shy smile in Talley’s directon
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Tankytyke Rageblade stood at the forge, hammering away at dents in her plate armour. “O yes, and that’s where that pinching was coming 
                    from. My, what a mess this armour is.”<br>
                    *Clang* *clang* *clang* She hammered away at a dent untl it was back to its original shape. She carefully went over her armour, finding 
                    dents in the plates that shouldn’t be there and using her hammer to reshape it to the way it should be.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    One by one, Læurell’s cousins approached her wearing their armour, presentng for a fnal inspecton. Læurell Gearbow dutfully inspected each 
                    set, using her superior observaton skills to look for any dirt, vegetaton, or stains that the others might have missed. Satsfed they were 
                    clean, the gnomes and other races took of their armour and hung it in the closet, waitng for when they had to use it again.</p>

                    Irean pulled her horse to a stop beside the inn in Boralus. Nyassa had said twenty minutes, and she figured she had ten minutes left before 
                    the other mage showed up. She dismounted, keeping a light hand on the reins while checking mail for the supplies cousin Læurell said she’d 
                    send.<br>
                    “O boy.” She murmured to herself. Her mail was full to overfowing with packages of food; she’d told Læurell she didn’t know how long she 
                    and the other mages would be gone from civilizaton, but she hadn’t expected *this*. It was just a simple exploraton trip, right? How long 
                    could that possibly take? “Oh my. Cousin Læurell definitely outdid herself this time.”<br>
                    “Could I get help unloading this, please?”<br>
                    “Of course! I brought some land sharks along for just in case.”<br>
                    Irean grimaced while nodding. ‘Just in case’ meant Ny was kinda sorta expectng an attack somewhere along the way, though hoping it wouldn’t 
                    happen.<br>
                    “Ny! Ire!” Sara arrived, totng a backpack – full of enchantng supplies, Ire was sure. Ire felt the whisper of wind at her back, and glanced 
                    around to see the other two mages standing straighter. “Nuffin?” Three rogues materialized.<br>
                    “May I has some cross-ants before you go please, Cousin Sara? I haven’t had any in so very long, and Cousin Quyl told me she heard 
                    from Cousin Læurell that it might be awhile before you come back.”<br>
                    “Of course, Lyri!” Sara conjured up some croissants for her red-haired cousin.<br>
                    “Messages every day, right, Cousin Ire? If there’s no word after a week, we *are* coming afer you.” The white haired mage nodded.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Nuffy’s raven swooped in from the north just as Læurell’s wolf hawk dropped in from the south.<br>
                    “You told her?” Læurell clutched the saddle as her mount hovered in the air. Nuffy nodded. “She agreed to send messages daily. I told her 
                    that if there was nothing after a week, we rogues would be coming afer her.”<br>
                    “Good. Thank you. We hunters would be joining you.”<br>
                    “Figgered.”
                    <span>****</span>
                    Irean’s black horse pranced nervously along next to Nyassa’s Mekgineer’s Chopper, which carried Lessära in the sidecar.<br>
                    “So where should we go frst?” Irean leaned towards the chopper below to be heard.<br>
                    “H’bout we visit Stormsong first?” Ny briefy looked up to answer before returning her attention to the road. Sara, surrounded by five 
                    sleeping kites, nodded eagerly.<br>
                    “Brennadam ho!” Sara quipped. Ny pushed down the gas peddle on her chopper, and Ire urged her steed to speed up. Charcoal launched into a 
                    gallop, chasing the speeding chopper down the road. “Wheeeeeeee!” Sara’s retreatng shout of enjoyment drifted back to horse and rider.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Arriving at the edge of the town, all three gnomes took a moment to survey the situaton. Irean’s blue eyes roamed around, her head 
                    swivelling from one directon to the opposite directon and back again; she was subliminally aware of the other two gnomes doing the same. 
                    The town *seemed* safe enough, with its residents wandering to and fro on their business; something that Irean couldn’t put her finger on 
                    made her nervous though, like something bad was about to happen. The gnomes exchanged glances, and became peripherally aware of a child 
                    approaching them. Despite misgivings and internal turmoil, they all three turned smiles on the approaching child, and raised a hand to 
                    wave in greetng. The child waved back, and then the town fell into shadow, a shiver of cold running down each gnomes back. They looked up, 
                    mouths gaping in alarm at the sight of orcs, trolls, and other members of the Horde rappelling down from zeppelins, from which the shadows 
                    came. Ire slid of her mount, preparing for her first cast; a quick glance to the left to see Ny and Sara also standing on the ground,
                    channeling magic for their frst casts. Ty, Ninja, Callie, Squee, and Mal she spotted hiding under the chopper, backs arched as far as they 
                    could go under the vehicle’s undercarriage. The frst opponent they were presented with was an orc; Ire stomped her feet, spraying a frost 
                    nova in his directon to arrest his forward movement. Ny scorched him, and Sara fnished him of with an arcane blast followed by arcane 
                    barrage. Thus began the war to stay alive. The three gnomes were fine working together to bring down foes, but it became harder as they 
                    started to get separated. Exhausted and cornered, they were finally caught, with nets dropped upon them.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Irean woke up groggily, dimly aware of being in a jail-type cell. As her awareness increased, she discreetly glanced around, looking for 
                    Sara and Ny.<br>
                    “Your friends will be back shortly.” Irean jumped a bit, then scanned the room again. A black Tauren stood against the far wall facing 
                    her.<br>
                    “How did you..?” She cut herself short as piercing blue eyes focused on her face.<br>
                    “I am sorry about this. The Horde may be at war with the Alliance, but it doesn’t mean we all agree with our leader’s methods. Orcs have honour, 
                    we have our connecton with the earth, even trolls have some code of honour, but the goblins and the forsaken, especially the Lady Windrunner...” 
                    The Tauren trailed of, shaking her shaggy head.<br>
                    “What’s to be done with us?”<br>
                    “Our leader would like to interrogate you three personally before executng you. If I can, I will not allow it.”<br>
                    “You disagree with gnome punting?”<br>
                    The Tauren chuckled a bit. “I do.”<br>
                    “We had five cats travelling with us.”<br>
                    “They only brought in you three, so I assume they didn’t find your pets.” The door opened, and no less than six orcs walked in, two carrying 
                    struggling gnomes.<br>
                    “It will be over soon.” One orc said gruffly as the two gnomes were dumped on the foor just inside the cell door; the door slammed shut, and 
                    the orcs left. Ire shuffled toward the two gnome-shaped lumps that represented her sisters-in-arms and closest friends. Ny struggled up to a 
                    sitting positon, her eyes squinched together; Sara’s eyes looked bruised.<br>
                    “Ny? Sara?” Ire used her quiet voice. “Are you ok?”<br>
                    “She.. showed us what our fate will be afer she’s done with us. She forced us to watch as she executed - no, ripped to shreds – Alliance 
                    prisoners. You were only spared because you were stll unconscious. She’s MEAN, and without conscience.” Ny allowed herself to be pulled up with 
                    Ire’s help.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    “When did you last hear from cousin Ire?” Lyricka had emerged from the bank on her *very* rare fun days, where she took a break from 
                    managing the bank for a day to go find things to stabbity stab before she went loopy with boredom.<br>
                    “Hasna been a week yet, but *has* been a few days... I have this gut feeling that something’s wrong.” Nuffin sat on the bank steps as she 
                    had been waitng for Lyri.<br>
                    “Then we should call the hunters and go pick up their trail from when we last got a letter.”<br>
                    “Aye. I will leave you to go fnd something to stabbity stab... will be back soon’s I get ahold of Niquie, and cousins Læurell, Gnawmallie, 
                    and Quyl.. or at least cousin Læurell so she can get ahold of the other two hunters.”<br>
                    “Good idea. See you in a bit, sis.”<br>
                    “Aye. I’m sure you will be glad when Sara’s back again so she can make you cross-ants.”<br>
                    “Will. A’most finished the stack she made me before they left.”
                    <span>*****</span>
                    “Wake up, litle gnomes. I have a plan to get you out of here.” Nyassa was the first to look in the Tauren’s directon.<br>
                    “How d’we know we can trust you?” Ny gave her a suspicious look.<br>
                    “Are you familiar with Chiefain Baine Bloodhoof?”<br>
                    “N’really.”<br>
                    “King Anduin Wrynn?”<br>
                    “Yes.”<br>
                    “Well, King Wrynn used to exchange leters with Chiefain Bloodhoof. And I happen to side with the Chiefain, rather than the Horde leader, 
                    Lady Windrunner.”<br>
                    “So what’s the plan?” Irean asked as all three of them gathered around the Tauren.
                    <span>*****</span>
                    Læurell took point, using every tracking skill at her disposal to pick up the mage’s trail. The three rogues melted into the shadows, 
                    spreading a protectve stealth net over the trio of hunters between the three of them. The hunter fnally picked up the trail, and all six 
                    gnomes travelled the path to Brennadam. As they approached the city, Læurell’s wolf gave a growl; the hunter responded by slowing the party 
                    down. She stopped her wolf at the bridge leading into the town, and gawked in horror at the Horde presence on the other side of said 
                    bridge.<br>
                    “Sis?” Gnawm’s voice trailed away as she came abreast of Læurell’s right side; Quyl’s mouth hung open in shock on her lef side. The hunters 
                    were peripherally aware of the rogues cautiously approaching, using shadow cover to get as close as they possibly dared while avoiding 
                    detecton; the quiet nature of their Llothien Prowler fox mounts was especially suited to this type of operaton. Quyl’s gray Admiralty 
                    stallion shifted in place nervously, feeding off the energy of his owner. As if by silent agreement, all three hunters dismounted 
                    simultaneously, Gnawm and Læurell readying their bows while Quyl readied her harpoon. First target: an orc that appeared to be wandering 
                    in the directon of the bridge. Læurell sent Cloudy and Shadow after him alongside Gnawm’s Amethystus, both of them flling him full of 
                    arrows as Quyl harpooned the same target, wading in beside her turtle Aquamarine with polearm swinging. What followed afer was a repeatng 
                    cycle of target picked and atacked, untl the Horde populaton in their closest area of infuence was no longer an issue. The hunters were 
                    peripherally aware that the rogues had been helping take down targets as well; they now joined the hunters in the discussion as to what to 
                    do next.<br>
                    “Need to fnd a commander type, don’t we? See if we can fnd out what happened to the mages?” Nuffin held her blades in defensive positon, 
                    eyes dartng about as she watched for possible threats approaching; the other two rogues mirrored her stance.<br>
                    “Dunno if we’ll get anything out of an orc, but it’s worth a try. Can you rogues spread out and see if you can fnd anybody important-
                    looking, and come back and let us hunters know? Please?” Quyl glanced around, making sure they were stll clear.<br>
                    “On it!” Lyricka and the rest of the rogues melted into the shadows once again.<br>
                    “Quyllie, you wouldn’t by any chance have a spyglass on you would you?”<br>
                    “I would, actually. In me saddlebags. Be right back.” Quyl hurried across the bridge to where the hunter’s mounts waited, retrieving her 
                    spyglass from a bag hanging down from her stallion’s saddle. Scurrying back across the bridge, she handed it to Gnawm, who had made the 
                    request. Gnawm lifed it to her eye afer taking the cover of the other end. Wyverns, zeppelins with bombs... ah!<br>
                    “Say, Læurell, take a look will you? What’s beyond all the wyverns and bomb-totng zeppelins? Do you see it?” She handed the spyglass over. 
                    Læurell let out a litle gasp when she saw it.<br>
                    “Think we could get onto that, Quyllie?” She handed the spyglass back to Quyl, so she could take a look to assess the likelihood of what 
                    she asked.<br>
                    “Well... harpoon’d work.... just need more rope I think... don’t have enough to reach with my current one.” Nufy and the other two rogues 
                    materialized at that moment.<br>
                    “Methinks we found the perfect target. Undead fire mage, a Captain Lockwood by name. We’ve heard whispers among the grunts, and saw him 
                    ourselves.”<br>
                    “Lead the way, Cousin Nuf. Think we might have ourselves a plan.”<br>
                    “I did see the spyglass. What have you found?” Niquie inclined her head towards Gnawm with interest, while stll keeping an eye out for 
                    Horde enemies.<br>
                    “A zeppelin, of course. Quyl says she just needs more rope to get aboard.”<br>
                    “We can fix that!” Afer that, talk was scarce, as they were presented with enemy afer enemy again. At one point, Lyri tapped Quyl’s arm 
                    and pointed; Quyl quickly spotted the mage they were afer through her spyglass, and endeavoured to direct the fghtng gnomes that way. 
                    Finally they arrived at the area where the mage was. Læurell took frst shot, with Gnawm interruptng his frst cast with counter shot; Quyl 
                    harpooned in, the rogues moving in to help with disabling their target. All three hunters pulled their pets of their target when they were 
                    sure he couldn’t atack them or get away. Lyri held her knives at the ready.<br>
                    “Where were the gnome mages taken?”<br>
                    The forsaken spit at her. “The Banshee Queen will have done away with them by now. You’re too late.” Lyricka looked him up and down, 
                    disgusted. She quickly stabbed him in the heart and walked away.<br>
                    “Forsaken are worse than orcs. Apparently Sylvannas has them. Need to move fast. You need more rope right, Cousin Quyllie?” Quyl nodded.<br>
                    “Let’s find some so we can rappel up to that zeppelin and get out of here. We have gnomes to rescue!”
                    <span>****</span>
                    The trip through Brennadam to look for rope proved to be relatvely uneventul; the gnomes easily rappelled up to the zeppelin and took 
                    control. The goblin at the helm was, in fact, quite willing to do as they asked, and set sail for Orgrimmar. The gnomes all took turns 
                    keeping an eye on their goblin helmsman, no mater how helpful he appeared to be; the rest of the gnomes caught up on sleep while one kept 
                    watch. Finally, they sailed into Ogrimmar, the goblin meekly pointng out that they would not be at all welcome, but instead hunted. Gnawm 
                    responded that their plan was to get in, free their fellow gnomes, and get out, as soon as possible. The goblin wished them good luck... 
                    and pointed out an arena where it was assumed any prisoners would be held near. Sylvanus, he admited, was fond of doing her dirty work in 
                    public. He then admited that if there was a way out of the Horde, he would take it, as he wasn’t at all fond of the wiles of their new 
                    leader. The gnomes thanked him for his kindness and helpfulness, then cautously exited the zeppelin, Quyl using her spyglass upon immediate 
                    departure to get a feel for how they were going to get from where they were to said arena.<br>
                    “Time to call the troops, I guess. Makes us less inconspicuous, but probly the best way to get from here to there. AND fastest.” Nufn 
                    called her raven, as did the other two rogues. “Hmm, yes. I think, for this venture, we should double up. Agreed?” Lyri and Niquie nodded 
                    vigorously, but the three hunters looked skeptcal.<br>
                    “Can they actually handle that much weight?” Quyl queried.<br>
                    “Looks like a short hop, so I *think* so.” Niquie replied. Three ravens now hovered at the edge of the rocky precipice, waitng for their 
                    riders to climb on. Læurell carefully balanced herself behind Nufn, while Quyl and Gnawmallie did the same behind Lyricka and Niquie. The 
                    rogues quickly and skillfully guided their mounts to the precipice upon which the arena sat, quickly dismountng both themselves and the 
                    hunters behind them to release the ravens into the skies above.
                    <span>****</span>
                    “It’s time litle ones. Let’s hope this plan works and doesn’t backfire.”<br>
                    “If you please, may I ask your name, Miss Tauren? I would like to count you as a friend, even if this doesn’t work the way it’s supposed 
                    to.” Irean extended her three-fngered hand towards the Tauren. “Us too!” Sara and Ny chimed in.<br>
                    “Of course you would. My name is T’bon Thunderhoof. Pleased to meet you, mages Irean, Nyassa, and Lessära. And now, litle gnomes, let’s see 
                    about getting you all out of here in one piece.” The orcs stomped into the cell, picked up their prisoners, and marched out of the cell 
                    again; Tbon followed like a shadow. The sunlight blinded the gnomes at frst, and they squinched their eyes closed untl they could slowly 
                    open them inch by painful inch. The scene before them was a bit jarring – or at least to Ire it was. Out of the corner of her eyes she 
                    could see Ny’s disgusted face, and Sara’s scowl.<br>
                    “Be brave, litle gnomes. I will do what I can.” T’bon was barely visible in cat form in the shadows of the arena before them. Like any 
                    druid, or rogue, she was using the shadows to cover her movements untl such a tme as she needed to reveal herself. Just as the orcs and 
                    their cargo entered the inner arena entrance, Sylvannas Windrunner congealed out of shadow in the very center; the gnomes cringed back 
                    away from her as one in the hands of their captors as they heard Tbon’s soft animal growl nearby. The Horde crowd caught sight of the 
                    gnomes in the orcs’ grip, and the jeering began. “Citzens of the Horde! I bring you a rare spectacle of gnomes today!” Cheers and jeers 
                    followed her pronouncement. Sylvanus drew her blades. “So, a queston to you of the Horde. Do I deal with them personally? Or... a trusted 
                    pet.” An orc led a black wolf into the arena, letting it prowl the arena afer Sylvanus acknowledged it and its handler. The Horde 
                    spectators, especially the orcs, started cheering with glee while pointng at the wolf wandering the arena. Sylvannas gave a nod to the 
                    spectators, and disappeared in a puff of smoke; the orcs holding the gnomes dropped their tny burdens, backing away to give the wolf a 
                    clear shot at the mages. The gnomes faced the approaching wolf square on, staffs at the ready to fend it of best as they could, having 
                    already determined that their magic was blocked by something or someone in the arena. T’bon’s lashing tail swung in and out of the shadows 
                    where she was hidden, preparing to pounce; more gnomes suddenly dropped into the arena, three sets of knives drawn as three rogues took up 
                    positon between their mage cousins. Three hunters stood a few steps in front, flanked by their pets.<br>
                    “Excellent timing!” Irean had a chance to get out before the gnomes were set upon by the giant wolf. It was all over in a manner of 
                    seconds, thanks mostly to the hunter’s pets; Sylvannas reappeared in a puff of smoke, blades at the ready – the danger was not over yet.<br>
                    “I suppose I should have dealt with you myself to begin with!” Before she could move, a shadow portal spawned itself between the banshee 
                    queen and the gnomes. A night elf stepped out.<br>
                    “Hurry! I can only hold this open for so long!” As the gnomes hurried into the portal, Ire caught the sight out of the corner of her eye 
                    of Sylvannas staring in consternaton and shock. The elf who had created the portal came through on the other side behind them; but they 
                    realized when they took a proper count that they had lost a third of their company.<br>
                    “Where’s Sara? And Gnawm? And Niquie?” Six distraught litle gnome voices questioned where their three comrades had gone. The elf knelt so 
                    she was on eye level.<br>
                    “I.. am sorry. I will go back through the portal to make sure they didn’t get left behind. The only other opton is that they got lost afer 
                    stepping through the portal. That happens sometmes, and I’m sorry to say that if that happened the I don’t know exactly where they went. 
                    And may never find them.” True to her word, the elf stepped back through the portal just before it closed.
                    <span>****</span>
                    “How DARE she defy me! I should have destroyed those litle morsels when I had the chance. Preposterous!” Sylvannas was over her shock, and 
                    enraged that she should see her sister popping out of thing air to help what she viewed as an inferior species. Of course, they were all 
                    inferior species compared to her, regardless if they were related to her or not. Had she not been seething so much, she might have notced a 
                    new portal open in the arena, might have noticed her sister, Alleria, walk out of said portal, look around as if searching for something, 
                    and then, nodding to herself as if satsfed whatever she was looking for wasn’t there, walking back into the portal.
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Sara? Are you seeing this?”<br>
                    “Where – where are we?”<br>
                    “I dunno. Think we be the only ones here though.” Niquie gave a sad sigh.<br>
                    “Aww. Lyri won’t be having any more cross-ants. In fact, I dunno if we’re *ever* gonna see *any* of them again.” Sara voiced her greatest 
                    fear.<br>
                    “Well, I guess if that’s it then we might as well go splorin’. See what we can see. At least we’re together."<br>
                    “At least there’s that, yes. One last grand adventure for all of us.”</p>

                    Læurell fnished tacking up her wolfawk mount for the morning ride, calling her leopard cat Cloudy over to join her once she was mounted. 
                    Frosty, her wolf, sat outside the barn, guarding his territory; white tiger Kuura was stretched out on the porch of the small cabin that 
                    was Læurell’s abode. Shockwave, her stone dragon turtle, was dozing on the shore of her pond, soaking up the sun’s morning rays.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Nuffin directed her raven mount to circle above the forest, looking for a clearing in which to land.<br>
                    Aha! Her bird tipped toward the ground, diving for the clearing, where she tumbled off an outstretched wing tipped towards the ground. She 
                    melted into the shadows as her mount took of again to find a perch in the upper trees somewhere.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Pink ponytails whirled through the air, the gnome whom they belonged to roaring in mock anger against an as of yet unseen foe. Blue eyes 
                    narrowed in concentraton, Noumi practced her spins, kicks, and punches, vanquishing imaginary enemies. Ban-Lu, her armoured tiger mount, 
                    rested just out of sight, waitng patently for her to fnish her morning routne.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Hoofeats broke the morning stllness, slowing as they reached the forest. The white-haired gnome ran a hand down the neck of her black 
                    steed, sliding off after he came to a stop. She headed to her favourite clearing, leaving her horse to graze where he was. She climbed up 
                    on her usual log to watch the sun rise, a sigh of contentment escaping her lips.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Blond-white ponytails bobbed in rhythm with running booted gnome feet, a warrior out on her daily run through the forest. She stopped on a 
                    hill to both catch her breath and strike at imaginary enemies with her twin swords; the blue blades looked reminiscent of those carried in 
                    another galaxy by peacemakers and negotiators, but the resemblance ended there. Dodging, whirling, striking, slicing the air to ribbons as 
                    if it was multiple attackers, she stopped once again to catch her breath, bathed in sweat, her armour squeaking a little due to the 
                    wetness. Morning workout done, she headed further into the forest to investgate the sights, sounds, and smells.
                    <span>****</span>
                    An avian screech echoed through the forest, its owner being an owl-faced looking creature with four legs, one of which leaked blood in a 
                    pool beneath it. A gnome stood nearby, black sprouts streaming out behind her as she cast a healing spell towards her injured mount. Flesh 
                    knit together under the golden aura, the wound sealing itself with the healing energies from the spell. The gnome lowered her head, 
                    murmuring soothing tones to her mount as she leaned against it, restng.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Læurell pointed her mount towards the sound of an animal in distress as soon as she heard it. Hunter she may be, but she was always caring 
                    towards her mounts and pets, making sure their needs were met physically as well as emotionally; even the animals she did kill were used 
                    properly, with no part going to waste. Meat for sustenance, bones for making arrows or needles, hide tanned and used for clothing, or 
                    repairing tack, organs left in a place that would benefit wild carnivores. Hearing an animal in distress was... distressing; her wolfawk 
                    stepped into a clearing, and stopped.<br>
                    “Cousin Lina?” The black-sprouted gnome separated herself from her Seeker mount reluctantly, Læurell thought.<br>
                    “Cousin Læurell? I didn’t expect to see anyone for miles...”<br>
                    Læurell coughed on a laugh. “I live about a quarter mile from here.”<br>
                    Emalina’s brown eyes grew big as saucers. “Oh?” 
                    <span>****</span>
                    Nuffin stepped out from behind a tree, approaching her two cousins. “Lina? What happened to your mount?”<br>
                    Lina’s saucer eyes glistened with tears. “It was awful. An orc wolf handler sicced his wolves on my Seeker, and they were in the process of 
                    trying to rip him to shreds when I got there.”<br>
                    “Why didn’t he fly?”<br>
                    “He was waitng for me.” Lina was looking at the ground, looking disturbed and embarrassed. Nufy rubbed Lina’s back in a comfortng gesture.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Ban-Lu stepped into the clearing, striding to a halt a few feet from the gathering of cousins and Seeker mount. All eyes fastened on Noumi 
                    afer she cleared her throat to get their atenton.<br>
                    “Normally, I don’t really care to make a distincton between Alliance and Horde, but setting wolves on a mount? That’s just reprehensible. 
                    How do we fix this so it never happens again to ANY of us? I know I’m the newest cousin to join the ranks of adventurers in this new land 
                    but...”<br>
                    “She’s right.” All heads swiveled towards the newcomer to the clearing, a white haired gnome.
                    <span>****</span>
                    Irean looked from gnome to gnome. “We’ve been soloing it in this new land, neither knowing nor caring, really, where our cousins are... or 
                    even how they’re doing. I think we need to pull ourselves together and start checking on each other to see if we need help. Heck, if need 
                    be we should group up all together. Safety in numbers right?”<br>
                    Heads were nodding in agreement.<br>
                    “Did somebody call for a tank?”
                    <span>****</span>
                    Tanky stood at the clearing entrance, white-blond hair waving gently in the breeze.<br>
                    “Well, a tank would certainly be appreciated.” Lina gave Tanky a shy smile.<br>
                    “Thank you for the offer Tanky... I have another idea in mind too.” Læurell waited untl she had everybody’s attention. “What if you all move 
                    into my place?” The answer wasn’t a unanimous yes, but Læurell had kind of fgured on that, and so she presented her arguments. “May I ask 
                    the question: how many of you live in the city, have to board your mounts somewhere, and come out here for the peace and quiet it 
                    provides?” Almost all of her cousins raised a reluctant hand. “Wouldn’t you rather have that peace and quiet all the time?”<br>
                    This tme, there was a unanimous “Yes!” from all the gnomes she was talking to. “It’s settled then? I’ll come help you guys move?”<br>
                    “Sounds good.” Irean said, and the rest of them nodded in agreement.</p>

                    (Hearken back to Burning Crusade expansion, where you could pick a Netherdrake mount afer reaching exalted with the Netherwing facton at 
                    max level; corresponding pics on my Facebook account)</i><br>
                    Irean directed her gryphon through the pass of Shadowmoon Valley, aiming for the floatng island beyond. Ensuring she had her Dragonmaw 
                    disguise donned, she descended to the orc camp, having been instructed to seek out an Overseer Mog’hor by name. The brown-skinned orc 
                    received her service papers without quibble, sending her out to kill overmine flayers, mine nethercite ore, gather nether crystals, poison 
                    non-cooperatve peons, and gather netherwing relics. Despite misgivings about poisoning peons and taking out dragonmaw transporters for 
                    relics, the gnome got to work, quite sure the overseer would not tolerate lack of action. Her greatest joy was mining the nethercite ore, 
                    or any ore really. Proving her worth to Mog’hor, she was further tasked with quelling a Murkblood uprising in the mines, as well as killing 
                    creatures in the same mine that were interfering with producton, recovering lost cargo also within the mine, and disciplining disobedient 
                    peons with a booterang that she herself had made under the tutelage of Chief Overseer Mudlump. She felt rather bad about using the 
                    booterang on peons, but it was fun throwing it. Having impressed Mudlump and Mog’hor with all the various skills she demonstrated while 
                    completing the tasks they gave her, Mog’hor decided to step up the pace of her training. He sent her and her mount off to test her flying 
                    skills against masters of flight under his command; she was to learn how to stay on her mount whilst dodging various things being thrown at 
                    her as she stayed on each master’s tail. It was hard work, but well worth it in the long run. There was all kinds of rocks and other debris 
                    floatng around the island, so the flight masters she was supposed to be following never had a shortage of things to throw at her so she could 
                    dodge them. She also got a request from an Illidari Lord Balthas to go gather materials to make a machine called a soul cannon, which he 
                    used to destroy his brother. (Irean surmised that his brother must be awfully nasty for him to want to do that.) Mog’hor sent her out to 
                    kill death shadow agents, thereby disruptng the twilight portal. Things got dicey afer that: Mog’hor tasked her with attacking the Sha’tar 
                    outpost – her allies in Shadowmoon! She agreed under the pretence of telling the Sha’tar outpost leader when she got there; Mog’hor seemed 
                    only too happy to see her go, and she wondered if he suspected. She went straight to Anchorite Ceyla as soon as she got back to the 
                    outpost, quickly detailing to her what had transpired. The anchorite went to gather forces to fght the Dragonmaw Skybreakers that would 
                    arrive when Irean used the flare gun; she also tasked Irean with gathering allies to help. Irean sent message afer message to her allies, 
                    hoping for a swift response, which she got. Ceyla gave the word, and Irean set of a flare to call the Skybreakers. They arrived, and the 
                    battle began. The frst wave arrived, and was dealt with just before the second wave arrived; wave afer wave, untl suddenly there were no 
                    more. Irean sighed in relief that her allies were safe once more, but she stll had trepidaton about going back to Mog’hor. She headed back 
                    to the island, talked to Taskmaster Varkule, and was sent to talk to Mog’hor. Mog’hor proceeded to tell her that she would be promoted by 
                    Lord Illidan Stormrage, and they proceeded to where Illidan was. Unfortunately, Illidan saw through her disguise, and verbally berated 
                    Mog’hor for even thinking of letting her into the ranks of his orcs, nevermind letng her ascend to the current positon she held. Mog’hor 
                    turned on her, but fortunately a dragon, by the name of Netheralku, snatched her from her fate, and flew off. The dragon, disguised as the 
                    orc Yarzil the Merc, flew back to the capital city Shattrath, where she met a dragon in elf from by the name of Barthamas. He thanked her 
                    profusely for saving his race, the Netherwing, and ofered her a gift: she could pick one of the Netherwing, and it would bond with her, and 
                    carry her on further journeys. She was given the choice of onyx, azure, veridian, purple, violet, or cobalt, and she chose onyx... the onyx 
                    Netherwing bowed it’s head to her before allowing her to mount and fly away on its back.</p>

                    Irean hugged the white-haired gnome priest in front of her. “So good to see you, Cousin Kiri! You said you had something to show me?”<br>
                    “Muhuh!” Kirrin turned around. “See?”<br>
                    Irean’s eyes grew large like saucers. “Ooooo!” She exclaimed in surprise and delight. “Prety kites! May I?”<br>
                    “Yes, you may.” Irean walked over to a black kitty mount, presentng it with a three-fngered hand to sniff. The cat gave a cursory sniff; she 
                    moved on to the next cat as it seemed the first was ignoring her.<br>
                    “So, which one would you like, Cousin Renie?” Kirrin asked as she fnished introducing herself to the kites. Irean turned ’round.<br>
                    “You mean, I get to pick one?”<br>
                    “You do!”<br>
                    “O, thank you. Tank *you*!” She turned ’round to study them all again.<br>
                    “May I has the black one, pleases?”<br>
                    “Of course!”<br>
                    “Umm.. d’you think I might be able to bring Miss ‘nae, Cousin Lina, Miss Talley, and Cousin Nuffy to look at ’em?... ‘Cuz I think when they 
                    see mine they’re gonna want one each too...”<br>
                    “Muhuh. They are welcome to come see.”<br>
                    <span>****</span>
                    “This one is *blue*... it *so* matches my skin!” Talley squealed. “That is, umm...” She trailed off in embarrassment.<br>
                    “Then you shall have it.” Kirrin smiled.<br>
                    “Thank you, Miss Kirrin.” Talley excitedly stroked the cat’s head.
                   <span>****</span>
                    “Kiri!” Emalina’s top sprout bounced as she threw her arms around her cousin-priest.<br>
                    “Lina!... You came to see kitties?”<br>
                    “Well, yeah... but I came to see you too!” Lina’s eyes landed squarely on the yellowy-gold cat; she sucked her breath in.<br>
                    “Want?”<br>
                    “Shall have.” Kirrin smiled. Lina immediately claimed it by placing a bubble shield around it.<br>
                    <span>**** </span>
                    “Fantastc!” Laurnae exclaimed upon seeing the cats.<br>
                    “Glad you like ’em.” Kirrin watched as ‘nae studied each cat.<br>
                    “Hmmm... I like the green one, but I also like the red one. Hmm.”<br>
                    “Can’t have both. Well, could I s’pose, but they would be competng for your attention.”<br>
                    “Oh, trust me, one cat is quite enough! I’ll take the green one, please.”<br>
                    “Alright.”<br>
                    Emeris watched from the shadows in cat form. “That green cat *will* be mine.” She mutered to herself.

                    Hi, my name is Nuffin Shadowblade. My parents always used to tell me I was born of shadow; they also quite frequently told me that I had 
                    the temper of some Irish humans they met – and the hair and eyes to boot. Ok.. so what does that tell me? Red hair, green eyes, hot temper, 
                    and the ability to be so quiet I can sneak anywhere – oh, and an affinity for hiding in the shadows.<br>
                    Maybe that’s why they named me Nuffin? Cuz I can disappear so easily? Anyway... as I grew older, it was hinted that maybe an apprentceship 
                    as a rogue would be the best idea for a career path. If it meant sneaking, count me in; and that’s how I ended up being brought to Mathias 
                    Shaw in my early teens to see if he, the master spy, could pair me up with a good rogue teacher. And that’s how I ended up here, apprentced 
                    to Kelsey Steelspark. As a fellow gnome, and possibly friend, she’s the best. As a teacher, she’s very tough on you, which is actually a 
                    good thing once you get used to her ways; she says the best way to learn is from experience and getting your hands dirty. She also doesn’t 
                    shirk her duty, nor let you shirk yours. Having said that, she IS willing to take you out into the feld and work side-by-side, so she’s 
                    definitely a hands-on teacher.<br>
                    “Ready for practce, Nuffin? A rogue always needs sharp combat skills!”<br>
                    “Be right there, Miss Steelspark!” This is how the day goes when not out in the field: knife throwing practce, sneaking practce, combat 
                    practice on the target dummies... a day full of actvites meant to sharpen the mind and reflexes. Afer all, we are spies as much as we are 
                    combat experts.. and sometimes assassins, depending on what the job entails. The phrase ‘You saw nuffin!’? Yeah, that wasn’t me who coined 
                    it, though I *have* taken it to heart. She coined it afer I scared the living daylights out of her by sneaking up on her in one of our 
                    training sessions. She went from furious that I scared her, to seriously applauding my ease and prowess at sneaking, to joking with me 
                    about it... and that’s where the phrase appeared to begin with. She’s said on numerous occasions that I’m her best operatve – hintng that 
                    I might even be surpassing her; that I highly doubt, but if I end up being considered an equal, that’s fine by me.<br>
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Good morning, fellow rogues. It has come to my attention through a meetng with King Wrynn that we have a situaton developing that requires 
                    our expertse. As such, I would like to send you out in teams two. We will be investgatng the threat of an old god by the name of N’zoth, 
                    so keep your eyes and ears open and trust no one. Any questons?” Kelsey raised her hand, and he motioned to her. “Miss Steelspark?”<br>
                    “Might we be allowed to pick our teammate?”<br>
                    “Of course. Please do. I know I just said trust no one, but I make an excepton here as I trust you all to make the best judgement call in 
                    choosing a teammate.”<br>  
                    “Thank you, sir.”<br>
                    “Any other questons?” I raised my hand.<br>
                    “Miss Shadowblade. I’ve heard you’re the most promising of the new recruits. Glad to have you on the team.”<br>
                    “Pardon me, sir, but is there anything at all we’re looking for?”<br>
                    “As of yet, no idea. Best course of acton is to trust your instncts at this point. If something seems of or wrong, it probably is.”<br>
                    “Thank you, sir.”<br>  
                    “Anyone else?” Silence greeted his queston. “I’ll take that as a no. Alright, people, you have your orders. I want you in teams and heading 
                    out as soon as possible.”<br>
                    <span>****</span>
                    “Nuffin?”<br>
                    “Yes, Miss Steelspark?”<br>
                    “Please, call me Kelsey. I owe you that much afer all the tme we’ve spent together training. In all respects you *are* my equal.”<br>
                    “You owe me? I don’t follow.”<br>
                    “You’ve worked so hard to get to the level of expertise you’re at. And I know I’ve pushed you *hard*. That’s ok, right? I saw so much 
                    potental in you when we frst started...”<br>
                    “Of course that’s ok. How else could I improve?”<br>
                    “So could you do me the small favour of calling me Kelsey? I know it will be hard to begin with.”<br>
                    I gave her a bit of a smile. “I think that can be arranged.”<br>
                    “Good. One more favour? Please?”<br>
                    “Yes?”<br>
                    “Would you mind being my teammate?”<br>
                    “Of course!”</p>
