    <button>Case Study</button>
    <br><strong>Project Title:</strong> Dorothy Delong
    <br><strong>Type & Scope:</strong> Project was a desktop website composition for a one-page portfolio site for a photographer. Scope or deliverables for 
    the project included website comp, logo, headshot photo, 6 sample photos, and 4 social media icons.
    <br><strong>Role:</strong> I was the designer of this comp, and asked for feedback from the client.
    <br><strong>Overview:</strong> The client, Dorothy Delong, needed a website for showing off her photography samples for magazines, and newest work, 
    contact info and artist’s statement for galleries.
    <br><strong>Goals & Problems Solved:</strong> Project goals were to reach magazines and galleries, while displaying raw feminism along with her unique 
    talents. Problems solved with this design were to display samples of different types of shots for magazines to view, so they can 
    determine what type of shot they want, as well as samples, contact info, and artist’s statement for galleries.
    <br><strong>Design Process:</strong> Step one of the design process was to make a wireframe, with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social 
    media icons would go. A grid is activited in this step as well, to align content so that there is plent of space around each section,
    and between elements.
    Step two was to find colours that fit the theme of the website. A little bit of research on the feminist movement yielded a flag 
    with the colours purple, white, and green, so I decided to take the purple and green, and pair it with pink, as pink usually 
    signifies femininity.  
    Step three was finding a font pair. I looked at quite a few script and display fonts before settling on Great Vibes for the title, 
    because I thought it fit Dorothy’s creativity. I did decide that maybe it wasn’t such a good idea for headings, so I went with 
    Roboto (a sans font) for the headings, content text, and navigation.
    Step four was to bring all the media images in, so all the sample images, the photographer’s headshot, the social media icons, and 
    the logo. 
    Step five was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the header, of course. I also decided
    to add Dorothy’s artist’s statement up there as well. In the about section, I put Dorothy’s headshot photo, and her target audience 
    side-by-side. In the work section, I decided to stack Dorothy’s sample photos in a 2 x 2 grid, which was later extended to a 2 x 3 
    grid after Dorothy’s feedback. The contact section contained Dorothy’s name and e-mail on the left side, and social media icons on 
    the right side.
    <br><strong>Challenges & Takeaways:</strong> The biggest challenge I’ve encountered with all design projects is adding enough whitespace between sections 
    and elements. Reaching out to instructors and fellow students for feedback and help was huge, and I believe I’m getting better. 
    Takeaways: add more whitespace so that every section and element can breathe.
    <br><strong>Conclusion:</strong> My design solved the problem of showing off samples for both magazines and galleries, as well as displaying the artist’s 
    statement and contact info for galleries.

    <p>Description: Mobile first design comp for ethically made, fair-trade, and fair labour chair company</p>
    <button>Case Study</button>
    <br><strong>Project Title:</strong> Sit Conmigo Mobile Comp
    <br><strong>Type & Scope:</strong> Project was a one-page portfolio website composition made for mobile, tablet, and desktop, made for an ethical, 
    sustainable, fair-trade, fair labour chair-making business. Scope or deliverables for this project were the 3 different sizes of 
    website for 3 different devices, as well as product photos, headshot photo, and logo for 3 different devices.
    <br><strong>Role:</strong> I was the designer of this comp, and asked for feedback from the client.
    <br><strong>Goals & Problems Solved:</strong> Goals for this website comp were to show photos of SIt Conmigo’s products, invite clients to pre-order 
    products, and show the owner’s dedication to sustainable, ethical, fair-trade, and fair labour products. Problems solved with design 
    were creating a comp that fit all device sizes, displaying Sit Conmigo’s products, a way to pre-order products, contact info, 
    mission statement and colours signifying a dedication to making products that are ethical, sustainable, fair-trade, and fair labour. 
    <br><strong>Design Process:</strong> Step one of the design process was to make three wireframes, one for mobile, one for tablet, and one for desktop, 
    with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social media icons would go. A grid is activited in this step as well, to align 
    content so that there is plent of space around each section, and between elements.
    Step two was to find colours that fit the theme of the website. A little bit of research on ethical, sustainable production yielded 
    the colours blue and green, and Yolanda said in her brief that she wanted something that creates excitement but doesn’t distract 
    from her chair’s photos, so I chose reddish as the third colour.
    Step three was finding a font pair. I chose Macondo font for the title because I thought it fit with the theme of sustainable and 
    ethical, and I used Montserrat for the headings and other text content as I thought a sans serif font also fit with the SIt Conmego 
    theme.
    Step four was to bring all the media images in, so all the sample images, the photographer’s headshot, the social media icons, and 
    the logo. I had to copy, resize, and place those two more times as there were three wireframes to work with.
    Step five was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the header, of course. In the about 
    section, I put Sit Conmigo’s mission, but I accidentally forgot to put the owner’s photo. In the work section, I decided to stack 
    Sit Conmigo’s product photos in a 2 x 2 grid. The contact section contained Sit Conmigo’s owner photo, phone and e-mail on the left 
    side, and social media icons on the right side.
    <br><strong>Challenges & Takeaways:</strong> Challenge number one: more whitespace. Challenge number two: the original colours I went with did not show 
    up very well agains the background. I ended up going with darker colours to make it show up better against the background. 
    Instructor feedback was a great help with making positive changes for accessibility reasons, as well as visual contrast.
    <br><strong>Conclusion:</strong> My design solved the problem of pre-ordering, along with providing product photos for clients to view, mission statement 
    detailing the owner’s dedication to ethical, sustainable, fair-trade and fair labour chairs, and contact information.

    <p>Skills: Wireframing, Web Design, Colour Theory, Typography, Branding</p>
    <p>Description: Landing page design comp for The Whole Bean coffee shop.</p>
    <button>Case Study</button>
    <br><strong>Project Title:</strong> The Whole Bean
    <br><strong>Type & Scope:</strong> Project was a landing page for coffe shop The Whole Bean, owned by Karla Kahvi. Scope or deliverables was a landing 
    page comp, logo, four social media icons, and three photos.
    <br><strong>Role:</strong> I was the designer of this comp, and asked for feedback from the client.
    <br>Overview: The Whole Bean’s owner needed a landing page to get word out about the coffee shop’s grand opening. Landing page needs to 
    get word out about the coffee shop’s grand opening, display a call to action, what the coffee shops offers for products, and contact 
    information.
    <br><strong>Goals & Problems Solved:</strong> Project goals were to announce the coffee shop’s grand opening, display contact information, shop offerings, 
    and call to action. Problems to be solved were acquiring client e-mails, displaying contact infromation and shop offerings, and 
    making the grand opening announcement.
    <br><strong>Design Process:</strong> Step one of the design process was to make one wireframe  with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social 
    media icons would go. A grid is activited in this step as well, to align content so that there is plent of space around each section, 
    and between elements.
    Step two was to find colours that fit the theme of the website. The message I wanted to convey with this page was friendly and 
    inviting. Colours I picked were orange for cheerful and cheerful, yellow for warmth, and grey for calm.
    Step three was finding a font pair. I chose Cooper STD font for the title and navigation because I thought it fit with the theme of 
    a friendly coffee shopl, and I used Open Sans for the headings and other text content as I thought a sans serif font also fit with 
    the Whole Bean theme.
    Step four was to bring all the media images in, so all the atmospheric images, the menu and product icons, the social media icons, 
    and the logo. 
    Step five was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the header, of course. The call to 
    action section held 3 photos side-by-side above the text. The signup section held the form for first name, last name, e-mail address, 
    and signup button. Also in that section was the menu and product listings, with a couple icons. The contact section held the Whole 
    Bean’s address, e-mail, and phone number on the left, and social media icons on the right.
    <br><strong>Challenges & Takeaways:</strong> Challenge one was whitespace, as per usual. Challenge two was alignment to the grid and the rest of the 
    content. Challenge number three was making sure the logo fit with the rest of the landing page, giving a friendly and inviting vibe 
    to the page. Takeaways were always add more whitespace than you think you need, make sure your content alignment is correct across 
    the whole page, and make sure *all* content, including colours and images, fit the vibe you are going for.
    <br><strong>Conclusion:</strong> My design presented a landing page that radiated friendliness with its colours, typography, images, and logo, while 
    announcing the coffee shops grand opening, giving details of where and when, gave a call to action for e-mails in exchange for a 
    hand-made pastry, gave menu and product details, and presented contact details.
