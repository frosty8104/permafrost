                    business's current website. The owner felt that her previous website, with its coloured pencil hero image, as well as 
                    the typography - Apple SD Gothic as main, Hiragino Kaku Gothic as primary typeface, and Avenir as secondary typeface - 
                    conveyed more of an educational feeling than the corporate feeling she wanted it to convey.</p>

                    <p><strong>Step one</strong> of the design process was to create basic wireframes. I started with 1024 pixel height, which gave it 
                    768 pixel width. I thought it was a good size for desktop until it was pointed out by one of the developers on the team that it was tablet 
                    size. I researched desktop website sizes and settled on 1280-pixel height by 1024-pixel width.</p>

                    Coolors, were black, hex #040707, international Klein blue, hex #102e96, gold, hex #a58129, white, hex #ffffff, and battleship grey, hex 
                    #8f9194. For contrast's sake, the original gold did have to be lightened to satin sheen gold, hex #bc942f, but after checking with Sierra,
