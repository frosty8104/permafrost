            <div class="house-design"><h3>Design Process:</h3> <strong>Step one</strong> of the design process was to create basic wireframes. I started with 1024 pixel height, which gave it 768 
            pixel width. I thought it was a good size for desktop, until it was pointed out by one of the developers on the team that it was tablet size. I researched desktop website sizes and 
            settled on 1280 pixel height by 1024 pixel width..</p>
            <p><strong>Step two</strong> We were provided with a brand guide, which provided brand colours, and the aforementioned typeface fonts. We were told she wanted to keep the brand 
            colours, but she was open to new fonts. Brand colours provided, according to Coolors, were black, hex #040707, international klein blue, hex #102e96, gold, hex #a58129, white, hex 
            #ffffff, and battleship grey, hex #8f9194. For contrast's sake, the orignal gold did have to be lightened to satin sheen gold, hex #bc942f, but after checking with Sierra, she was ok 
            with the change.</p>

            <p><strong>Step three</strong> was finding font typefaces that were freely available for publishing, as the client was hiring us on a volunteer basis and looking to minimize the costs 
            of the redesign. We settled on Cormorant SC for title, Montserrat for headers, and Quicksand for paragraph.</p>
            <p><strong>Step four</strong> was a bit of a long process because not all media images were availabel at once. Started with the House of Light logo. and only 3 of of the pictured 
            being available for the Ghana Project page. I was able to rescue 3 partner logos from a Google doc, but the rest of the logos and images came along later.</p>
            <p><strong>Step five</strong> My co-designer, Matt, made the header and footer for the pages, as well as a hero image for the homepage. For the Ghana Project page, he added a video 
            placeholder to my page design, and I handled the majority of the partners, careers, press, services, contact, and products pages, while he handled the majority of the about frequently 
            asked questions, and about us page. We both added tweaks as needed after the pages were mostly finished, as there was more information that we either missed or received from the owner

<!-- Type & Scope: House of Light, an educational and corporate organization providing services for blind and visually impaired students and workers, needed a redesign as requested by Sierra 
Dockery, the organization's owner. Scope or deliverables was a redesigned website of twelve pages worth. 

Role: I was one designer of two on a team of two designers and two developers. We the team had weekly meetings with the owner for feedback. 

Overview: House of Light owner Sierra Dockery needed her website redesigned so it was more corporately professional than her busines' current website. The owner felt that her previous website, 
with it's coloured pencil hero image, as well as the typography - Apple SD Gothic as main typeface, Hiragino Kaku Gothic as primary typeface, and Avenir as secondary typeface - conveyed more of an educational feeling than the corporate feeling she wanted it to convey. 

Goals & Problems Solved: The primary project goal was to redesign the website so it felt more corporately professional than the previous one. 

Design Process: 
Step one of the design process was to create basic wireframes. I started with 1024 pixel height, which gave it 768 pixel width. I thought it was a good size for desktop, until it was pointed out 
by one of the developers on the team that it was tablet size. I researched desktop website sizes and settled on 1280 pixel height by 1024 pixel width. 

Step two We were provided with a brand guide, which provided brand colours, and the aforementioned typeface fonts. We were told she wanted to keep the brand colours, but she was open to new fonts. 
Brand colours provided were black, hex #040707, international klein blue, hex #102e96, gold, hex #a58129, white, hex #ffffff, and battleship grey, hex #8f9194. For contrast's sake, the orignal 
gold did have to be lightened to satin sheen gold, hex #bc942f, but after checking with Sierra, she was ok with the change. 

Step three was finding font typefaces that were freely available for publishing, as the client was hiring us on a volunteer basis and looking to minimize the costs of the redesign. We settled on 
Cormorant SC for title, Montserrat for headers, and Quicksand for paragraph. 

Step four was a bit of a long process because not all media images were availabel at once. Started with the House of Light logo. and only 3 of of the pictured being available for the Ghana Project 
page. I was able to rescue 3 partner logos from a Google doc, but the rest of the logos and images came along later. 

Step five My co-designer, Matt, made the header and footer for the pages, as well as a hero image for the homepage. For the Ghana Project page, he added a video placeholder to my page design, and 
I handled the majority of the partners, careers, press, services, contact, and products pages, while he handled the majority of the about frequently asked questions, and about us page. We both 
added tweaks as needed after the pages were mostly finished, as there was more information that we either missed or received from the owner as the design and development progressed. 

Challenges & Takeaways: Still having trouble at times putting enough white space in between sections for breathing room, but I'm working on it. Working on this project helped me grow a lot due to 
working in a team and getting real time feedback from my fellow teammates and the client pushing me to hone my designs. 

Conclusion: Our design presented all the important parts, like brand colours, logo, and typography, along with a consult, donation, and sponsorship button, info in the about us page, services, 
partner logos, press posts, team members, open positions, contact info, products, and faqs.
