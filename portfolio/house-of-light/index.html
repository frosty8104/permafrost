                    <p>House of Light, an educational and corporate organization providing services for blind and visually impaired 
                    students and workers, needed a redesign as requested by Sierra Dockery, the organization's owner. We ended up with 
                    a redesigned website of twelve pages worth.

                <p>House of Light owner Sierra Dockery needed her website redesigned so it was more corporately professional than her 
                business's current website. The owner felt that her previous website, with its coloured pencil hero image, as well as 
                the typography - Apple SD Gothic as main, Hiragino Kaku Gothic as primary typeface, and Avenir as secondary typeface - 
                conveyed more of an educational feeling than the corporate feeling she wanted it to convey.</p>

                <h3>Design Process:</h3>
                <p><strong>Step one</strong> of the design process was to create basic wireframes. I started with 1024 pixel height, which gave it 
                768 pixel width. I thought it was a good size for desktop until it was pointed out by one of the developers on the team that it was tablet 
                size. I researched desktop website sizes and settled on 1280-pixel height by 1024-pixel width.</p>

                <p><strong>Brand colours:</strong> We were provided with a brand guide, which provided brand colours, and the aforementioned 
                typeface fonts. We were told she wanted to keep the brand colours, but she was open to new fonts. Brand colours provided, according to 
                Coolors, were black, hex #040707, international Klein blue, hex #102e96, gold, hex #a58129, white, hex #ffffff, and battleship grey, hex 
                #8f9194. For contrast's sake, the original gold did have to be lightened to satin sheen gold, hex #bc942f, but after checking with Sierra, 
                she was ok with the change.

                Quicksand for paragraph.
