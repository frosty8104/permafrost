                <h3>Type & Scope:</h3> 
                <p>The project was a landing page for the coffee shop The Whole Bean, owned by Karla Kahvi. Scope was a landing page comp, logo, four social 
                media icons, and three photos.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bean-role">
                <h3>Role:</h3> 
                <p>I was the designer of this comp and asked for feedback from the client.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bean-view">
                <h3>Overview:</h3> 
                <p>The Whole Bean’s owner needed a landing page to get word out about the coffee shop’s grand opening. The landing page needs to get word 
                out about the coffee shop’s grand opening, display a call to action, what the coffee shop offers for products, and contact information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bean-goals">    
                <h3>Goals & Problems Solved:</h3> 
                <p>Project goals were to announce the coffee shop’s grand opening, display contact information, shop offerings, and call to action. Problems 
                to be solved were acquiring client e-mails, displaying contact information and shop offerings, and making the grand opening announcement.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bean-design">
                <h3>Design Process:</h3> 
                <p><strong>Step one</strong> of the design process was to make one wireframe with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social media 
                icons would go. A grid is activated in this step as well, to align content so that there is plenty of space around each section, and between 
                elements.</p>

            <div class="bean-palette">
                <p><strong>Colour palette process</strong> was to pick colours that fit the theme of the website. The message I wanted to convey with this 
                page was friendly and inviting. The colours I picked were orange for cheerful, yellow for warmth, and grey for calm.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="bean-font">
                <p><strong>Font pairing</strong> was to decide on a font pairing that would be readable while putting forth a cheery, welcoming atmosphere. 
                I picked Cooper Std for the title and all-important call to action button, and Open Sans for the paragraph text.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bean-content">
                <p><strong>Content import process</strong> was to bring all the media images in, so all the atmospheric images, the menu and product icons, 
                the social media icons, and the logo. The logo and menu and product icons I made earlier in the design process. The atmospheric images I 
                picked out from a free stock image site called Unsplash, and the social media icons came from a site called Font Awesome.</p>
            </div>      
            <div class="bean-layout">
                <p><strong>Layout process</strong> was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the header, of 
                course. The call to action section held 3 photos side-by-side above the text. The signup section held the form for first name, last name, 
                e-mail address, and signup button. Also in that section was the menu and product listings, with a couple icons. The contact section held the 
                Whole Bean’s address, e-mail, and phone number on the left, and social media icons on the right.</p>

                <h3>Challenges & Takeaways:</h3> 
                <p>Challenge one was whitespace, as per usual. Challenge two was alignment to the grid and the rest of the content. Challenge number three 
                was making sure the logo fit with the rest of the landing page, giving a friendly and inviting vibe to the page. Takeaways were always add 
                more whitespace than you think you need, make sure your content alignment is correct across the whole page, and make sure *all* content, 
                including colours and images, fit the vibe you are going for.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>My design presented a landing page that radiated friendliness with its colours, typography, images, and logo, while announcing the coffee 
            shop's grand opening, giving details of where and when, gave a call to action for e-mails in exchange for a hand-made pastry, gave menu and 
            product details, and presented contact details.</p>
