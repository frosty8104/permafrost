            <div class="type"><h3>Type & Scope:</h3> Project was a landing page for coffe shop The Whole Bean, owned by Karla Kahvi. Scope or deliverables was a landing 
            page comp, logo, four social media icons, and three photos.</div>
            <div class="role"><h3>Role:</h3> I was the designer of this comp, and asked for feedback from the client.</div>
            <div class="logo"><img id="img" src="../../img/bean-logo.png" alt="The Whole Bean logo" /></div>
            <div class="view"><h3>Overview:</h3> The Whole Bean’s owner needed a landing page to get word out about the coffee shop’s grand opening. Landing page needs to 
            get word out about the coffee shop’s grand opening, display a call to action, what the coffee shops offers for products, and contact 
            information.</div>
            <div class="goals"><h3>Goals & Problems Solved:</h3> Project goals were to announce the coffee shop’s grand opening, display contact information, shop offerings, 
            and call to action. Problems to be solved were acquiring client e-mails, displaying contact infromation and shop offerings, and 
            making the grand opening announcement.</div>
            <div class="style"><img id="img" src="../../img/whole-bean-style-tile.png" alt="Style tile for The Whole Bean's coffee shop grand opening landing page" /></div>
            <div class="design"><h3>Design Process:</h3> Step one of the design process was to make one wireframe  with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social 
            media icons would go. A grid is activited in this step as well, to align content so that there is plent of space around each section, 
            and between elements.<br>
            Step two was to find colours that fit the theme of the website. The message I wanted to convey with this page was friendly and 
            inviting. Colours I picked were orange for cheerful and cheerful, yellow for warmth, and grey for calm.<br>
            Step three was finding a font pair. I chose Cooper STD font for the title and navigation because I thought it fit with the theme of 
            a friendly coffee shop, and I used Open Sans for the headings and other text content as I thought a sans serif font also fit with 
            the Whole Bean theme.<br>
            Step four was to bring all the media images in, so all the atmospheric images, the menu and product icons, the social media icons, 
            and the logo. <br>
            Step five was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the header, of course. The call to 
            action section held 3 photos side-by-side above the text. The signup section held the form for first name, last name, e-mail address, 
            and signup button. Also in that section was the menu and product listings, with a couple icons. The contact section held the Whole 
            Bean’s address, e-mail, and phone number on the left, and social media icons on the right.</div>
            <div class="comp"><img id="img" src="../../img/whole-bean-landing.jpg" alt="The Whole Bean landing page final comp" /></div>
            <div class="challenge"><h3>Challenges & Takeaways:</h3> Challenge one was whitespace, as per usual. Challenge two was alignment to the grid and the rest of the 
            content. Challenge number three was making sure the logo fit with the rest of the landing page, giving a friendly and inviting vibe 
            to the page. Takeaways were always add more whitespace than you think you need, make sure your content alignment is correct across 
            the whole page, and make sure *all* content, including colours and images, fit the vibe you are going for.</div></section></main>
        <footer><div class="conclude"><h3>Conclusion:</h3> My design presented a landing page that radiated friendliness with its colours, typography, images, and logo, while 
        announcing the coffee shops grand opening, giving details of where and when, gave a call to action for e-mails in exchange for a 
        hand-made pastry, gave menu and product details, and presented contact details.<div class="folio">
