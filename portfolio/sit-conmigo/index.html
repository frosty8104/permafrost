                sustainable, fair-trade, fair labour chair-making business. Scope of deliverables for this project were the 3 different 
                sizes of website for 3 different devices, as well as product photos, headshot photos, and logo for 3 different 
                devices.</p>

                <h3>Overview:</h3> 
                <p>Yolanda Lopez, owner of Sit Conmigo and my client, needed a website where her clients could pre-order chairs, see her 
                mission statement, and find ways to contact her.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="chair-goals">
                <h3>Goals & Problems Solved:</h3> 
                <p>Goals for this website comp were to show photos of Sit Conmigo’s products, invite clients to pre-order products, and 
                show the owner’s dedication to sustainable, ethical, fair-trade, and fair labour products. Problems solved with design 
                were creating a comp that fit all device sizes, displaying Sit Conmigo’s products, a way to pre-order products, contact 
                info, mission statement and colours signifying a dedication to making products that are ethical, sustainable, fair-trade, 
                and fair labour.</p>

                <h3>Design Process:</h3> 
                <p><strong>Step one</strong> of the design process was to make three wireframes, one for mobile, one for tablet, and one 
                for desktop, with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social media icons would go. A grid is activated in this 
                step as well, to align content so that there is plenty of space around each section, and between elements.</p></div>           
            <div class="chair-palette">
                <p><strong>Colour palette creation</strong> was to find colours that fit the theme of the website. A little bit of research 
                on ethical, sustainable production yielded the colours blue and green, and Yolanda said in her brief that she wanted 
                something that creates excitement but doesn’t distract from her chair’s photos, so I chose reddish as the third 
                colour.</p></div>
            <div class="chair-style">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="chair-font">
                <p><strong>Font pairing</strong> was finding a font pair. I chose Macondo font for the title because I thought it fit with 
                the theme of sustainable and ethical, and I used Montserrat for the headings and other text content as I thought a sans 
                serif font also fit with the Sit Conmigo theme.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="chair-content">
                <p><strong>Content import process</strong> was to bring all the media images in, so all the sample images, the 
                photographer’s headshot, the social media icons, and the logo. I had to copy, resize, and place those two more times as 
                there were three wireframes to work with.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="chair-mobile">

            </div>
            <div class="chair-layout">
                <p><strong>Layout process</strong> was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the 
                header, of course. In the about section, I put Sit Conmigo’s mission, but I accidentally forgot to put the owner’s photo. 
                In the work section, I decided to stack Sit Conmigo’s product photos in a 2 x 2 grid. The contact section contained Sit 
                Conmigo’s owner photo, phone and e-mail on the left side, and social media icons on the right side.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="chair-challenge">
                <h3>Challenges & Takeaways:</h3> 
                <p>Challenge number one: more whitespace. Challenge number two: the original colours I went with did not show up very well 
                against the background. I ended up going with darker colours to make it show up better against the background. Instructor feedback 
                was a great help with making positive changes for accessibility reasons, as well as visual contrast.</p>

                detailing the owner’s dedication to ethical, sustainable, fair-trade, and fair labour chairs and contact information.</p>
