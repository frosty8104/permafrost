            <section id="conmigo">
                <div id="scope"><h2>Type & Scope:</h2> Project was a one-page portfolio website composition made for mobile, tablet, and desktop, made for an ethical, 
                sustainable, fair-trade, fair labour chair-making business. Scope or deliverables for this project were the 3 different sizes of website for 3 different 
                devices, as well as product photos, headshot photo, and logo for 3 different devices.</div>
                <div class="role"><h2>Role:</h2> I was the designer of this comp, and asked for feedback from the client.</div>
                <div id="goals"><h2>Goals & Problems Solved:</h2> Goals for this website comp were to show photos of SIt Conmigo’s products, invite clients to pre-order 
                products, and show the owner’s dedication to sustainable, ethical, fair-trade, and fair labour products. Problems solved with design were creating a comp 
                that fit all device sizes, displaying Sit Conmigo’s products, a way to pre-order products, contact info, mission statement and colours signifying a dedication 
                to making products that are ethical, sustainable, fair-trade, and fair labour.</div>
                <div class="process"><h2>Design Process:</h2> Step one of the design process was to make three wireframes, one for mobile, one for tablet, and one for desktop, 
                with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social media icons would go. A grid is activited in this step as well, to align content so that there is plenty 
                of space around each section, and between elements.<br>
                Step two was to find colours that fit the theme of the website. A little bit of research on ethical, sustainable production yielded the colours blue and green, 
                and Yolanda said in her brief that she wanted something that creates excitement but doesn’t distract from her chair’s photos, so I chose reddish as the third 
                colour.<br>
                Step three was finding a font pair. I chose Macondo font for the title because I thought it fit with the theme of sustainable and ethical, and I used Montserrat 
                for the headings and other text content as I thought a sans serif font also fit with the Sit Conmego theme.<br>
                Step four was to bring all the media images in, so all the sample images, the photographer’s headshot, the social media icons, and the logo. I had to copy, resize, 
                and place those two more times as there were three wireframes to work with.<br>
                Step five was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the header, of course. In the about section, I put Sit Conmigo’s 
                mission, but I accidentally forgot to put the owner’s photo. In the work section, I decided to stack Sit Conmigo’s product photos in a 2 x 2 grid. The contact 
                section contained Sit Conmigo’s owner photo, phone and e-mail on the left side, and social media icons on the right side.</div>
                <div class="challenge"><h2>Challenges & Takeaways:</h2> Challenge number one: more whitespace. Challenge number two: the original colours I went with did not show 
                up very well agains the background. I ended up going with darker colours to make it show up better against the background. Instructor feedback was a great help 
                with making positive changes for accessibility reasons, as well as visual contrast.</div>
        </section></main>
        <footer><h2>Conclusion:</h2> My design solved the problem of pre-ordering, along with providing product photos for clients to view, mission statement 
        detailing the owner’s dedication to ethical, sustainable, fair-trade and fair labour chairs, and contact information.<br>
