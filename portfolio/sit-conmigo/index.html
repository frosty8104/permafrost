            <div class="type"><h3>Type & Scope:</h3> <p>Project was a one-page portfolio website composition made for mobile, tablet, and desktop, made for an ethical, 
            sustainable, fair-trade, fair labour chair-making business. Scope or deliverables for this project were the 3 different sizes of 
            website for 3 different devices, as well as product photos, headshot photo, and logo for 3 different devices.</p></div>
            <div class="role"><h3>Role:</h3> <p>I was the designer of this comp, and asked for feedback from the client.</p></div>
            <div class="logo"><figure><img id="img"src="../../img/logo-desktop.png" alt="Sit Conmigo logo" /></figure></div>
            <div class="view"><h3>Overview:</h3> <p>Yolanda Lopez, owner of Sit Conmigo and my client, needed a website where her clients could pre-order chairs, see her mission statement, and 
            find ways to contact her.</p></div>
            <div class="goals"><h3>Goals & Problems Solved:</h3> <p>Goals for this website comp were to show photos of Sit Conmigo’s products, invite clients to pre-order 
            products, and show the owner’s dedication to sustainable, ethical, fair-trade, and fair labour products. Problems solved with design 
            were creating a comp that fit all device sizes, displaying Sit Conmigo’s products, a way to pre-order products, contact info, 
            mission statement and colours signifying a dedication to making products that are ethical, sustainable, fair-trade, and fair labour.</p></div>
            <div class="design"><h3>Design Process:</h3> <p><strong>Step one</strong> of the design process was to make three wireframes, one for mobile, one for tablet, and one for desktop, 
            with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social media icons would go. A grid is activited in this step as well, to align 
            content so that there is plent of space around each section, and between elements.</p>
            <p><strong>Step two</strong> was to find colours that fit the theme of the website. A little bit of research on ethical, sustainable production yielded 
            the colours blue and green, and Yolanda said in her brief that she wanted something that creates excitement but doesn’t distract 
            from her chair’s photos, so I chose reddish as the third colour.</p>
            <div class="style"><figure><img id="img" src="../../img/style-tile-sit-conmigo.png" alt="Style tile for Sit Conmigo's chair-selling website" /></figure></div>
            <p><strong>Step three</strong> was finding a font pair. I chose Macondo font for the title because I thought it fit with the theme of sustainable and 
            ethical, and I used Montserrat for the headings and other text content as I thought a sans serif font also fit with the SIt Conmego 
            theme.</p>
            <p><strong>Step four</strong> was to bring all the media images in, so all the sample images, the photographer’s headshot, the social media icons, and 
            the logo. I had to copy, resize, and place those two more times as there were three wireframes to work with.</p>
            <p><strong>Step five</strong> was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the header, of course. In the about 
            section, I put Sit Conmigo’s mission, but I accidentally forgot to put the owner’s photo. In the work section, I decided to stack 
            Sit Conmigo’s product photos in a 2 x 2 grid. The contact section contained Sit Conmigo’s owner photo, phone and e-mail on the left 
            side, and social media icons on the right side.</p></div>

            <div class="challenge"><h3>Challenges & Takeaways:</h3> <p>Challenge number one: more whitespace. Challenge number two: the original colours I went with did not show 
            up very well agains the background. I ended up going with darker colours to make it show up better against the background. 
            Instructor feedback was a great help with making positive changes for accessibility reasons, as well as visual contrast.</p></div></section></main>
        <footer><div class="conclude"><p><h3>Conclusion:</h3> My design solved the problem of pre-ordering, along with providing product photos for clients to view, mission statement 
        detailing the owner’s dedication to ethical, sustainable, fair-trade and fair labour chairs, and contact information.</p>
