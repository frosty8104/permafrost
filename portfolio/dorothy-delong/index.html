            <div class="type"><h3>Type & Scope:</h3> <p>Project was a desktop website composition for a one-page portfolio site for a photographer. Scope or deliverables for 
            the project included website comp, logo, headshot photo, 6 sample photos, and 4 social media icons.</p></div>
            <div class="role"><h3>Role:</h3> <p>I was the designer of this comp, and asked for feedback from the client.</p></div>

            <div class="view"><h3>Overview:</h3> <p>The client, Dorothy Delong, needed a website for showing off her photography samples for magazines, and newest work, 
            contact info and artist’s statement for galleries.</p></div>
            <div class="goals"><h3>Goals & Problems Solved:</h3> <p>Project goals were to reach magazines and galleries, while displaying raw feminism along with her unique 
            talents. Problems solved with this design were to display samples of different types of shots for magazines to view, so they can 
            determine what type of shot they want, as well as samples, contact info, and artist’s statement for galleries.</p></div>
            <div class="style"><figure><img id="img" src="../../img/style-tile-dorothy.png" alt="Style tile for Dorothy's photography website" /></figure></div>
            <div class="design"><h3>Design Process:</h3><p><strong>Step one</strong> of the design process was to make a wireframe, with shapes to mark where text, photos, logo, and social 
            media icons would go. A grid is activited in this step as well, to align content so that there is plent of space around each section,
            and between elements.</p>
            <p><strong>Step two</strong> was to find colours that fit the theme of the website. A little bit of research on the feminist movement yielded a flag 
            with the colours purple, white, and green, so I decided to take the purple and green, and pair it with pink, as pink usually 
            signifies femininity.</p>  
            <p><strong>Step three</strong> was finding a font pair. I looked at quite a few script and display fonts before settling on Great Vibes for the title, 
            because I thought it fit Dorothy’s creativity. I did decide that maybe it wasn’t such a good idea for headings, so I went with 
            Roboto (a sans font) for the headings, content text, and navigation.</p>
            <p><strong>Step four</strong> was to bring all the media images in, so all the sample images, the photographer’s headshot, the social media icons, and 
            the logo.</p>
            <p><strong>Step five</strong> was to decide placement and pattern. Logo, title, and navigation should always go in the header, of course. I also decided
            to add Dorothy’s artist’s statement up there as well. In the about section, I put Dorothy’s headshot photo, and her target audience 
            side-by-side. In the work section, I decided to stack Dorothy’s sample photos in a 2 x 2 grid, which was later extended to a 2 x 3 
            grid after Dorothy’s feedback. The contact section contained Dorothy’s name and e-mail on the left side, and social media icons on 
            the right side.</p></div>

            <div class="challenge"><h3>Challenges & Takeaways:</h3> <p>The biggest challenge I’ve encountered with all design projects is adding enough whitespace between sections 
            and elements. Reaching out to instructors and fellow students for feedback and help was huge, and I believe I’m getting better. 
            Takeaways: add more whitespace so that every section and element can breathe.</p></div></section></main>
        <footer><div class="conclude"><p></p><h3>Conclusion:</h3> My design solved the problem of showing off samples for both magazines and galleries, as well as displaying the artist’s 
        statement and contact info for galleries.</p><div class="folio"><a href="../index.html">Portfolio</a></div></div></footer>
